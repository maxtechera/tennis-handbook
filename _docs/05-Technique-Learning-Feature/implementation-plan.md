## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Data Models & Types
```typescript
// src/types/technique.ts
interface Technique {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'forehand' | 'backhand' | 'serve' | 'volley' | 'return';
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  lessons: Lesson[];
}

interface Lesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  order: number;
  duration: number; // minutes
  content: LessonContent;
  checkpoint?: Quiz;
  drills: Drill[];
}

interface UserProgress {
  userId: string;
  techniqueProgress: Map<string, TechniqueProgress>;
  skillLevel: SkillLevel;
  achievements: Achievement[];
}
```

### 1.2 Skill Assessment System
- Create quiz component with 10-15 questions
- Questions assess:
  - Current playing level
  - Tennis experience
  - Physical fitness level
  - Available practice time
  - Equipment access
- Algorithm to determine starting point
- Store results in localStorage

### 1.3 Progress Tracking Infrastructure
- localStorage schema for progress data
- Progress calculation algorithms
- Achievement system setup
- Analytics integration points

## Phase 2: Core Components Development (Week 2)

### 2.1 TechniquePlayer Component
```tsx
interface TechniquePlayerProps {
  videoUrl: string;
  markers: VideoMarker[];
  slowMotionSegments: TimeSegment[];
  annotations: Annotation[];
}
```
Features:
- Play/pause/speed controls
- Chapter markers for key points
- Slow-motion toggle for critical sections
- Overlay annotations
- Mobile-optimized controls

### 2.2 InteractiveCheckpoint Component
- Multiple choice questions
- Visual recognition tasks
- Technique ordering exercises
- Immediate feedback
- Progress gating (must pass to continue)

### 2.3 PracticeDrill Component

   - Eastern grip positioning
   - Semi-western transition
   - Grip pressure points
   - Common grip errors
   - 3 practice drills

2. **Stance & Footwork** (Lesson 2)
   - Open vs closed stance
   - Weight transfer mechanics
   - Split step timing
   - Recovery positions
   - 4 footwork drills

3. **Swing Mechanics** (Lesson 3)
   - Preparation phase
   - Contact point
   - Follow-through
   - Kinetic chain
   - 5 technique drills

4. **Power & Control** (Lesson 4)
   - Topspin generation
   - Flat drives
   - Angles and placement
   - Consistency drills
   - 4 match-play drills

5. **Common Mistakes** (Lesson 5)
   - Video comparisons
   - Self-diagnosis checklist
   - Correction exercises
   - Progress assessment

### 3.2 Content Templates
Create MDX templates for:
- Lesson pages
- Drill descriptions
- Video integration
- Quiz components
- Progress summaries

## Phase 4: User Experience Features (Week 4)

### 4.1 Personalized Learning Path
```tsx
interface LearningPath {
  currentTechnique: string;
  currentLesson: number;
  recommendedNext: string[];
  dailyPracticeTime: number;
  practiceSchedule: Schedule;
}
```
