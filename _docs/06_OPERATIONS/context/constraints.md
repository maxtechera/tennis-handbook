# Tenis Manual Constraints & Guidelines

**Purpose**: Document what NOT to do based on project values, technical requirements, and past learnings.  
**Usage**: Check against these constraints before implementing new features or making changes.

## üö´ Performance Constraints

### Never Break 95+ Lighthouse

- **Constraint**: Lighthouse score must stay above 95

- **How**: Test performance impact before deploying any feature
- **Alternative**: Use progressive enhancement or server-side only

### No Heavy JavaScript Frameworks

- **Constraint**: Avoid adding React Query, Redux, heavy state management
- **Why**: Bundle size impacts performance scores
- **How**: Use React Context and localStorage for state
- **Alternative**: Server-side features via API endpoints

### Image Optimization Required

## ‚ùå Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
2. **Feature Creep**: Stay focused on daily training companion vision
3. **English-First Thinking**: Always design for Spanish users
4. **Performance Regression**: Test impact before deploying
5. **Ignoring Mobile**: 60%+ users are on mobile devices
6. **Complex Onboarding**: Keep signup process minimal
7. **Assuming Behaviors**: Spanish ‚â† English user patterns

**Remember**: These constraints protect the core value propositions: performance, Spanish market advantage, and user trust. When in doubt, choose the path that maintains these three pillars.
