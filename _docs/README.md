## 🎯 The Tennis Handbook Story

This documentation tells the story of how we built a **#1 ranking tennis training platform** by combining three unique advantages:

1. **Elite Coach Access**: We documented the actual training methods of Ferrero (Alcaraz) and Panichi (Sinner)
2. **Spanish Market Discovery**: Our i18n implementation revealed Spanish users engage 3x more than English
3. **Content-First Architecture**: 300+ pages and 224 citations before adding any features

Every document in this hub reinforces these advantages and shows how to leverage them for growth.
