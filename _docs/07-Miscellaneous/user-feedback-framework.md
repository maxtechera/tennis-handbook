# User Feedback Framework - Tennis Handbook Platform Evolution

**Purpose**: Validate PRD assumptions and gather user input before implementing major platform changes

## üéØ Key Questions We Need Answered

### 1. Current Pain Points Validation
- Is "information overload" your biggest challenge?
- Do you struggle to know where to start?
- How important is mobile usage during workouts?
- What's missing from the current experience?

### 2. Proposed Solution Validation
- Would a "Today's Training" simplified view help?
- Do you want to track your progress?
- Is the dual-mode (simple daily + deep knowledge) appealing?
- What features would you actually use?

### 3. Priority Discovery
- What's more important: Daily workout guidance or deep knowledge?
- Would you use progress tracking features?
- How often do you access the site?
- What device do you primarily use?
