# ADR-007: Elite Coach Methodology Focus

> **Status: ACCEPTED** | Date: 2024-11-01

## Context
The tennis training market is crowded with generic fitness content. We needed clear differentiation to stand out and provide unique value. Research showed a gap in documenting and sharing elite coach methodologies from coaches like Juan Carlos Ferrero and Marco Panichi.

## Decision
Focus content exclusively on elite coach methodologies and training systems used by top ATP/WTA players, rather than generic tennis fitness content.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear market differentiation achieved
- Created 300+ pages of unique Ferrero/Panichi content
- Established authority in elite tennis training
- Attracted serious players and coaches
- Natural premium positioning for monetization

### Negative
- Limited audience to serious/competitive players
- Requires ongoing research and validation
- Content creation more complex and time-intensive
- Need access to elite coaching materials and methods
