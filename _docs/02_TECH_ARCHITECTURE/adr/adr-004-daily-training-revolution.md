# ADR-004: Daily Training Revolution Strategy

> **Status: ACCEPTED** | Date: 2025-01-05

## Context
Simple paywall models weren't solving the engagement problem. Research showed fitness apps successfully charge €19-39/month by providing daily value. We needed a strategy that both monetizes and increases engagement, not just restricts content.

## Decision
Adopt a "Daily Training Revolution" strategy focused on delivering daily personalized workouts and tracking, rather than just static content behind a paywall.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Validated 60%+ user interest in daily training features
- 40%+ pricing tolerance at €19-29/month range
- Solves engagement problem while monetizing
- Creates recurring value justifying subscription
- Differentiates from static training content sites

### Negative
- Requires building dynamic workout generation system
- Need backend infrastructure for personalization
- Higher development complexity than simple paywall
- Ongoing content creation needs for daily variety
