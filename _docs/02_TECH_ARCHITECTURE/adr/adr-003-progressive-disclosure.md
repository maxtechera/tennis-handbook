# ADR-003: Progressive Disclosure Architecture

> **Status: ACCEPTED** | Date: 2025-01-15

## Context
Users were overwhelmed by 300+ pages of free content with less than 5% completion rate. This created poor user experience and no clear path to monetization. We needed a way to guide users through content progressively while creating value for premium features.

## Decision
Implement a progressive disclosure strategy where users unlock content gradually through email signup and engagement, rather than having all content freely available immediately.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Expected 2x increase in email signups
- Clear monetization path through premium unlocks
- Better user experience with guided learning paths
- Improved engagement through structured progression
- Ability to track user progress and personalize experience

### Negative
- Initial friction for users wanting immediate access
- Complex implementation of unlock mechanisms
- Need to maintain free/locked content states
- Risk of users abandoning if too restrictive
