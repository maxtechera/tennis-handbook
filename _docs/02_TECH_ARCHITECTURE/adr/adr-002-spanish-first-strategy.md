# ADR-002: Spanish-First Development Strategy

> **Status: ACCEPTED** | Date: 2025-01-10

## Context
Analytics showed Spanish users demonstrate 3x engagement across all metrics compared to English users. Spanish visitors stay on the site for 18 minutes average compared to 6 minutes for English users. This presents a clear market opportunity for monetization.

## Decision
We decided to adopt a Spanish-first monetization approach, prioritizing Spanish language features, content, and premium offerings before English equivalents.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Focus resources on highest-engagement audience (3x metrics)
- Faster path to revenue with proven engaged user base
- Clear market differentiation in Spanish tennis training
- Reduced complexity by focusing on single language initially

### Negative
- Delayed English monetization features
- May alienate existing English user base
- Need to maintain two language versions long-term
- Spanish-specific features may not translate well to English market
