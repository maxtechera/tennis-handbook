# ADR-005: 100% Spanish Translation with Cultural Adaptation

> **Status: ACCEPTED** | Date: 2024-12-15

## Context
Analytics identified a significant Spanish market opportunity. Rather than partial translation, we needed to commit to full Spanish content with cultural adaptation to maximize engagement in this market.

## Decision
Implement 100% Spanish translation of all content with cultural adaptation, not just literal translation. This includes Spanish-specific tennis terminology, coach references, and training culture.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Achieved 3x engagement validation (18min vs 6min session time)
- Created authentic Spanish tennis training resource
- Established trust with Spanish-speaking audience
- Enabled Spanish-first monetization strategy

### Negative
- Significant translation and maintenance overhead
- Need to maintain content parity between languages
- Cultural adaptations may diverge from original content
- Requires Spanish-speaking support and community management
