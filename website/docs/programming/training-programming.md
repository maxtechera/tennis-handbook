---

## Navigation Index

This comprehensive training programming system is organized into specialized modules for enhanced navigation and implementation:

### Core Programming Components

**[Periodization Models](./periodization-models)**

- Concurrent training management and interference mitigation
- Linear, block, and undulating periodization models
- Seasonal programming frameworks
- Advanced periodization concepts for tennis

**[Training Templates](./training-templates)**

- 3-day, 4-day, and 5-day training templates
- Beginner, intermediate, and advanced workout structures
- Exercise selection and volume distribution guidelines
- Progressive overload methods and deload strategies

**[Auto-Regulation](./auto-regulation)**

- RPE-based training adjustments
- Performance-based modifications
- Fatigue indicators and management protocols
- Program modification guidelines

**[Competition Preparation](./competition-preparation)**

- Tapering protocols for peak performance
- Competition week management
- Between-match recovery strategies
- Return to training post-competition

## Quick Reference Programming Guidelines

### Training Frequency Recommendations

**Beginner Tennis Players:**

- **Frequency**: 3 days per week
- **Focus**: Movement pattern development and basic strength
- **Template**: Full-body training with fundamental exercises
- **Integration**: Coordinate with tennis skill development

**Intermediate Tennis Players:**

- **Frequency**: 4 days per week
- **Focus**: Strength and power development
- **Template**: Upper/lower split with power emphasis
- **Integration**: Balance strength training with tennis practice

**Advanced Tennis Players:**

- **Frequency**: 5+ days per week
- **Focus**: Peak performance and competition preparation
- **Template**: Specialized daily training with auto-regulation
- **Integration**: Sophisticated periodization with competition calendar

### Exercise Selection Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - Foundation (60-70% of volume):**

- Squat variations, deadlift variations, pressing movements, pulling movements

**Tier 2 - Tennis-Specific (20-25% of volume):**

- Rotational patterns, explosive movements, unilateral exercises

**Tier 3 - Injury Prevention (10-15% of volume):**

- Shoulder health, hip stability, movement preparation

**Tier 4 - Optional Accessories (0-10% of volume):**

- Aesthetic work, weak point training

## Implementation Pathway

### Getting Started (Week 1-4)

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current fitness level and movement quality
2. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate training frequency and complexity
3. **Exercise Learning**: Master fundamental movement patterns
4. **Tennis Integration**: Coordinate strength training with court time

### Development Phase (Week 5-12)

1. **Progressive Overload**: Systematically increase training demands
2. **Periodization**: Implement chosen periodization model
3. **Auto-Regulation**: Learn to adjust training based on readiness
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track strength, power, and tennis performance

### Advanced Implementation (3+ months)

1. **Specialization**: Focus on specific performance limiters
2. **Competition Preparation**: Implement tapering and peaking strategies
3. **Long-Term Planning**: Coordinate with annual tennis calendar
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Refine based on individual response
