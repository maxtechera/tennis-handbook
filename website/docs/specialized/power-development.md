## Key Principles Summary

### **Power Development Hierarchy:**

1. **Strength Foundation** ‚Üí Build maximum strength base
2. **Power Development** ‚Üí Convert strength to explosive power
3. **Speed Integration** ‚Üí Apply power at tennis-specific velocities
4. **Sport Transfer** ‚Üí Integrate with tennis skills and competition

### **Tennis-Specific Power Priorities:**

- **Serve Power**: Overhead strength ‚Üí explosive acceleration ‚Üí racket speed
- **Groundstroke Power**: Rotational strength ‚Üí hip drive ‚Üí racket acceleration
- **Court Movement**: Multi-directional strength ‚Üí reactive power ‚Üí movement efficiency
- **Injury Prevention**: Progressive loading ‚Üí movement quality ‚Üí recovery integration

### **Programming Considerations:**

- **Periodization**: Block or concurrent approaches based on goals
- **Recovery**: High neural demand requires strategic recovery planning
- **Individual Response**: Monitor and adjust based on athlete adaptation
- **Tennis Integration**: Time power training to complement tennis practice
