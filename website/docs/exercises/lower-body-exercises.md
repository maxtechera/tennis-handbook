# Lower Body Exercise Database

_Evidence-based lower body strength training for tennis court movement, power, and injury prevention_

:::info **Tennis Performance Research**
Research shows that proper strength training should "emulate the sequential coordination involved in ground stroke production" while targeting "stabilizing musculature involved in developing force or protecting body parts from stressful actions"¹. The lower body provides "necessary stability, agility, and explosive power for swift movements and effective shot-making"².
:::

:::warning **Injury Prevention Priority**
Tennis players commonly exhibit quadriceps-hamstring imbalances, with the hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratio requiring at least 60% (ideally 75%) to prevent injury³. Imbalances can increase injury incidence by 4.66 times⁴, making targeted strength training essential.
:::

:::tip **2024 Research Update**
Recent 2024 research on gluteal muscle forces identifies optimal exercises for each gluteal muscle, with loaded single-leg Romanian deadlifts providing tier-1 activation for all three gluteal muscles⁵.
