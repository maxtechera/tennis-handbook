## Exercise Selection Guidelines

### Progression Principles

1. **Master Bodyweight**: Perfect bodyweight movement before adding load
2. **Bilateral to Unilateral**: Master bilateral movements before single-limb variations
3. **Stable to Unstable**: Build strength in stable environments first
4. **Simple to Complex**: Progress from basic to complex movement patterns
5. **Volume Before Intensity**: Build volume tolerance before increasing intensity

### Tennis-Specific Considerations

1. **Movement Patterns**: Prioritize exercises that mirror tennis movements
2. **Unilateral Training**: Include single-limb exercises for sport specificity
3. **Rotational Power**: Emphasize rotational and multi-planar movements
4. **Range of Motion**: Train through tennis-specific ranges of motion
5. **Energy System Match**: Consider the energy demands of tennis

### Safety Protocols

1. **Always Warm-Up**: Never skip movement preparation
2. **Progress Gradually**: Avoid dramatic increases in training load
3. **Monitor Fatigue**: Adjust exercises based on fatigue levels
4. **Address Imbalances**: Include corrective exercises as needed
5. **Recovery Integration**: Plan recovery as carefully as training
