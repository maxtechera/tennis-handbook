# **Week 12 – Elite Competition Peaking & Performance Optimization**

_Objective: Achieve peak nervous system function, optimize power expression, and arrive at competition in optimal physical and mental condition for breakthrough performance._

---

## **COMPETITION PEAKING PHILOSOPHY**

### **Core Principles**

- **Neural Sharpening**: Maintain explosive capacity while eliminating fatigue
- **Movement Quality**: Perfect movement patterns under competition stress
- **Energy Optimization**: Peak glycogen stores and nervous system readiness
- **Competition Simulation**: Replicate exact competition demands and routines
- **Confidence Building**: Demonstrate peak capabilities in controlled environment

### **Week 12 Targets**

## **COMPETITION OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Neural System Optimization**

- **Daily HRV Monitoring**: Ensure >95% of baseline before competition
- **CNS Testing**: Vertical jump within 5% of peak, tap test optimal
- **Movement Quality**: Video confirmation of technical excellence
- **Mental State**: Confidence rating 9-10/10, excitement vs anxiety

### **Energy System Optimization**

- **Glycogen Loading**: +50-75g extra carbohydrates 48h before competition
- **Hydration Protocol**: 35ml/kg daily + competition-specific timing
- **Supplement Timing**: Creatine maintenance, beetroot shot 2h pre-competition
- **Sleep Optimization**: 9+ hours for 3 nights before competition

### **Competition Readiness Checklist**
