# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Elite Tennis Training Knowledge Platform Evolution

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the transformation of the Elite Tennis Training website to serve two critical needs:

1. **Daily Training Companion**: A simple, mobile-friendly interface for daily use during actual training sessions - showing today's workout, guiding through exercises, and tracking progress.

2. **Ultimate Knowledge Base**: The world's most comprehensive repository of elite tennis training research, methods, and science - available for deep exploration when desired.

The goal is to solve the "too much information" problem by creating a clean daily interface while preserving and expanding our research-backed knowledge base. Users should be able to quickly access their daily training OR dive deep into the science - their choice.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Information Overload**: Users report being overwhelmed by 300+ navigation items and extensive content from the first visit
2. **Unclear Starting Points**: Difficult to know where to begin or what path to follow
3. **No Progress Tracking**: Users cannot track what they've learned or their training progress
4. **Poor Content Discovery**: Hard to find relevant information when needed
5. **Lack of Personalization**: Same experience for beginners and advanced users

### User Feedback

- "Too much information from the get-go"
- "Hard to know where to go next"
- "Want to track my progress without using a separate app"
- "Love the research depth but need better organization"
- "I just want to see a daily guide to become the best possible"
- "Need something I can use during my workout on my phone"
- "Want to understand the 'why' but also just tell me what to do today"

---

## 🚀 Vision & Goals

### Vision

Create a dual-purpose platform that serves as:
- **The daily training guide** you open every day at the gym/court (simple, mobile-optimized, practical)
- **The definitive knowledge base** for tennis training science and methods (comprehensive, searchable, ever-growing)

This is not a workout app - it's a knowledge platform with a practical daily interface.

### Primary Goals

1. **Reduce Initial Overwhelm**: Progressive disclosure of information based on user needs
2. **Guide User Journeys**: Clear paths based on goals and experience levels
3. **Enable Progress Tracking**: Simple tools for both learning and training progress
4. **Maintain Research Depth**: Keep all valuable content accessible for those who seek it
5. **Scale for Future Content**: Easy integration of new PDFs, videos, and guides

### Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Daily return visits (not just one-time browsing)
- **Learning Progress**: Concepts mastered and articles completed
- **Training Consistency**: Program completion rates
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduced complaints about overwhelm
- **Content Discovery**: Increased depth of exploration

---

## 🎓 Philosophy Preservation

This evolution maintains and enhances our core philosophy:

### Research-Backed Excellence
- Every recommendation backed by scientific research
- Elite coach methods (Ferrero, Panichi) remain central
- Academic rigor in content organization
- Professional standards throughout

### Progressive Complexity
- Academic terminology preserved in deeper layers
- Simplified entry points lead to complex knowledge
- Research citations enhanced with "Research Trail" feature
- Multiple valid paths to expertise

### Knowledge First, Application Second
- Focus on understanding "why" before "how"
- Education about workouts, not workout tracking
- Complement to training apps, not competition
- Maintain identity as knowledge repository
