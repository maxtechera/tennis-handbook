# NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION
# 1. All sections are optional except metadata, timeline, and assessments
# 2. Attribution is embedded throughout for credibility
# 3. Flexible enough for any sport or training style
# 4. Preserves all specific athlete/coach references
# 5. Maintains backward compatibility with existing components
# 6. Supports beautiful layout rendering
# 7. Enables parallel agent development through clear dependencies
# 8. Provides transformation utilities for seamless migration
