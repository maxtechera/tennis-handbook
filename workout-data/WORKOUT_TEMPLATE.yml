# 1. All sections are optional and composable
# 2. Attribution is embedded throughout for credibility
# 3. Table formats are supported for exercise data
# 4. Flexible enough for any sport or training style
# 5. Preserves all specific athlete/coach references
# 6. Supports beautiful layout rendering
# 7. Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
# 8. Day-specific sections can be added as needed
# 9. Supports both structured data and rich media integration
