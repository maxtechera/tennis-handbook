## Competition Preparation Principles

### Peak Performance Characteristics

**Optimal Competition State:**

- **Low Fatigue**: Accumulated training fatigue dissipated through reduced volume
- **High Neural Drive**: Nervous system primed through maintained intensity
- **Optimal Body Composition**: Peak muscle mass with minimal excess body fat
- **Movement Quality**: Technical skills sharp and automatic

**Physiological Markers:**

- Resting heart rate at or below baseline
- Heart rate variability within normal range
- Subjective energy levels high (8-10/10)
- Movement quality and coordination optimal

**Performance Indicators:**

- Strength and power outputs maintained or improved
- Speed and agility testing at peak levels
- Tennis-specific skills executed consistently
- Mental focus and confidence high

### Competition Phase Training Philosophy

**Training Priorities (In Order):**

1. **Tennis Skill Maintenance**: Technical and tactical proficiency
2. **Power Preservation**: Maintain explosive capabilities
3. **Movement Quality**: Efficiency and injury prevention
4. **Recovery Optimization**: Maximum recovery between matches

**Volume Distribution:**

- **Tennis Training**: 70-80% of total training time
- **Strength/Power**: 15-20% of total training time
- **Recovery/Mobility**: 10-15% of total training time
