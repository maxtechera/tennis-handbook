# Homepage Conversion Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive conversion optimization implemented on the tennis training handbook homepage to maximize onboarding wizard completion rates.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Simplified Hero Section**

#### Changes:

- **Simplified messaging**: More direct value proposition: "Train Like Alcaraz & Sinner"
- **Added urgency banner**: Appears after 10 seconds showing social proof ("Join 12,000+ players")

#### Visual Hierarchy:
```
Title: Train Like Alcaraz & Sinner
↓
Subtitle: Get a personalized training plan based on the exact methods their coaches use
↓
Social Proof: 12,000+ Players | 73% Avg. Improvement
↓
Single CTA: Get Your Personalized Plan (2 min) →
↓
Trust Indicators: ✓ No credit card ✓ Instant personalization ✓ Science-backed
```

### 2. **Removed Competing Sections**

#### Removed:

#### Replaced With:
- **Testimonials Section**: Social proof with real player quotes
- **Benefits Section**: Explains why personalization matters
- **FOMO Section**: Live counter showing recent signups

### 3. **Social Proof & Urgency Elements**

1. **Hero Stats**:
   - "12,000+ Players Training"
   - "73% Avg. Improvement"

### 4. **Advanced Wizard Triggers**

#### Auto-Triggers:

2. **Exit Intent**: Detects when mouse leaves viewport
3. **Scroll Trigger**: At 30% page scroll
4. **Time Reminder**: Floating reminder after 45 seconds

#### Tracking:
Each trigger tracks its source for A/B testing:
```javascript
sendEvent({
  event: 'wizard_triggered',
  category: 'Onboarding',
  label: 'exit_intent|scroll_trigger|auto_timer|manual_click|time_reminder',
  properties: {
    language: currentLanguage,
    delay_seconds: 2, // for timer-based
    scroll_percentage: 30, // for scroll-based
  }
});
```

### 5. **Conversion-Focused Structure**

#### Page Flow:
1. **Hero**: Single CTA to start wizard
2. **FOMO**: Social proof and urgency
3. **Testimonials**: Build trust, single CTA
4. **Benefits**: Explain personalization value, single CTA

All CTAs lead to the same action: starting the wizard.
