This implementation adds a comprehensive email capture system to Tennis Handbook with the following features:

### Components Created

1. **EmailCaptureForm** - Main form component with 4 variants:
   - `hero` - Large format for homepage hero section
   - `inline` - Standard format for content pages
   - `popup` - Modal format for timed popups
   - `footer` - Compact format for sticky footer

2. **EmailCapturePopup** - Timed popup that appears after 3 minutes
   - 24-hour cooldown between displays
   - Remembers if user is already subscribed
   - Tracks engagement with analytics

3. **EmailCaptureBar** - Sticky footer bar
   - Appears 5 seconds after page load
   - Can be dismissed permanently
   - Compact design for mobile

4. **ContentEmailCapture** - Wrapper for MDX content pages
   - Easy to embed in documentation
   - Automatic source tracking

## Usage Examples
