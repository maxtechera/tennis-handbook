## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### **"I Don't Have Time for Full Sessions"**

**Problem:** Session taking 2+ hours  
**Solution:** Prioritize core movements, reduce rest periods  

**Minimum Effective Dose:**
- Keep main strength exercises (squats, deadlifts, pressing)
- Reduce accessory work by 50%
- Use 90-second rest periods instead of 3 minutes
- Focus on movement quality over load

**Time-Saving Strategies:**
- Superset non-competing exercises
- Use bodyweight alternatives when setup time is long
- Pre-plan equipment setup the night before

### **"Equipment Not Available"**

**Problem:** Gym doesn't have specific equipment  
**Solution:** Use the [Equipment Guide](/equipment-guide) substitutions

**Most Common Substitutions:**
- **No Trap Bar:** Use regular deadlifts or dumbbell RDLs
- **No Medicine Ball:** Use heavy dumbbell for slams
- **No Cables:** Resistance bands with door anchor
- **No Plyo Box:** Use stairs or stable bench

### **"HRV Consistently Low"**

**Problem:** Daily HRV readings 10%+ below baseline  
**Solutions:**

**Week 1-2:** Reduce training intensity by 20%, focus on movement quality  
**Week 3+:** Take 2-3 complete rest days, reassess sleep and nutrition  
**Persistent Issues:** Consider stress management, medical consultation

**HRV Recovery Protocol:**
1. Prioritize 8+ hours sleep
2. Reduce training volume by 30-50%
3. Increase recovery modalities
4. Address life stress factors

### **"Exercises Feel Too Easy/Hard"**

**Problem:** Wrong loading or intensity  
**Auto-Regulation Solutions:**

**Too Easy (RPE <6):**
- Increase load by 10-15%
- Add 1-2 reps per set
- Reduce rest periods slightly
- Focus on movement velocity

**Too Hard (RPE >9):**
- Decrease load by 15-20%
- Reduce reps by 1-2
- Increase rest periods
- Focus on perfect form

## üí™ Form & Technique Issues

### **"My Squats Don't Feel Right"**

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Forward lean | Limited ankle mobility | [Ankle mobility work](/exercises/exercise-database#ankle-circles--calf-raises) |
| Knee cave | Weak glutes | [Band walks](/exercises/exercise-database#lateral-band-walks) activation |
| Can't reach depth | Hip flexor tightness | [Hip flexor stretching](/exercises/exercise-database#world-s-greatest-stretch) |

### **"Pull-ups Are Impossible"**

**Progression Strategy:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Band-assisted pull-ups
2. **Week 3-4:** Negative-only pull-ups (3-5 second descent)
3. **Week 5-6:** Single rep attempts with band assistance
4. **Week 7+:** Bodyweight pull-ups

**Daily Practice:** 3 x 30-second dead hangs

### **"Medicine Ball Work Feels Awkward"**

**Technique Checklist:**
- Start with lighter weight (4-6kg)
- Focus on full-body engagement
- Emphasize explosive intent over distance
- Practice movement pattern without ball first

## üîÑ Recovery Issues

### **"Always Sore/Tired"**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Sleep Assessment:** Track actual sleep hours vs. target 8+
2. **Nutrition Check:** Ensure adequate protein (2g/kg) and carbs
3. **Hydration:** 35ml/kg daily minimum
4. **Training Load:** Reduce by 20% for one week

**Progressive Recovery Plan:**
- Week 1: Focus on sleep optimization
- Week 2: Add nutrition improvements
- Week 3: Implement consistent recovery protocols
- Week 4: Gradually return to full training

### **"No Time for Recovery Protocols"**

**Minimum Daily (5 minutes):**
- 2 minutes: Deep breathing
- 2 minutes: Key muscle stretching
- 1 minute: Cold shower finish

**Weekly Priority (20 minutes):**
- 10 minutes: Foam rolling session
- 10 minutes: Complete mobility routine

## üìä Progress & Assessment Issues

### **"Not Seeing Improvements"**

**Assessment Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Focus on movement quality, not numbers
- **Week 3-4:** Small strength improvements expected
- **Week 5-6:** Noticeable power and tennis improvements
- **Week 7+:** Significant performance changes

**What to Track:**
- Movement screen improvements (most important early indicator)
- Sleep quality trends
- Energy levels during training
- Tennis performance feel

### **"Numbers Getting Worse"**

**Common Causes:**
1. **Overreaching:** Reduce intensity, increase recovery
2. **Poor testing conditions:** Ensure consistent testing environment
3. **Life stress:** Factor in work/personal stress levels
4. **Accumulating fatigue:** Take planned deload week

## üéæ Tennis Integration Issues

### **"Training Interfering with Tennis"**

**Schedule Optimization:**
- **Morning Strength + Afternoon Tennis:** Best for most athletes
- **Same Day:** 4+ hours between sessions
- **Tennis Priority Days:** Reduce strength training by 50%

**Competition Week Adjustments:**
- Week of competition: No strength training
- 3 days before: Light movement only
- Day before: Complete rest or gentle movement

### **"Tennis Performance Declining"**

**Likely Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Fatigue Accumulation:** Implement deload week
2. **Technique Changes:** Focus on movement quality
3. **Neural Fatigue:** Reduce explosive training temporarily
4. **Confidence Issues:** Return to familiar patterns

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Equipment Problems

### **"Home Gym Limitations"**

**Space Constraints:**
- Use adjustable dumbbells instead of full rack
- Focus on bodyweight progressions
- Utilize outdoor space for plyometrics
- Create folding/portable setup

**Budget Constraints:**
- Start with [budget setup](/equipment-guide#under-200-complete-setup)
- Buy equipment progressively month by month
- Consider used equipment marketplace
- Partner with training buddy to share costs

---

## üì± Technology & Tracking Issues

### **"HRV App Not Working"**

**Alternative Methods:**
- Manual resting heart rate tracking
- Subjective readiness scale (1-10)
- Sleep quality assessment
- Energy level monitoring

**Backup Options:**
- Multiple HRV apps for comparison
- Wearable device integration
- Manual pulse counting technique

### **"Can't Track Everything"**

**Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Training completion** (most important)
2. **Sleep quality**
3. **Energy levels**
4. **Movement quality**
5. **Detailed metrics** (least important)

**Simple Tracking:**
- Daily 1-10 scales for energy and recovery
- Weekly photo progress
- Monthly measurement updates

## üöÄ Getting Back on Track

### **"Missed a Week of Training"**

**Return Protocol:**
- **1 week missed:** Resume with 20% reduced intensity
- **2 weeks missed:** Restart current phase at 30% reduction
- **3+ weeks missed:** Drop back one full phase

**Gradual Return:**
- Week 1: Movement quality focus
- Week 2: 70% of previous loads
- Week 3: 85% of previous loads
- Week 4: Full intensity restoration

### **"Lost Motivation"**

**Re-engagement Strategies:**
1. **Return to 'why':** Review tennis performance goals
2. **Small wins:** Focus on completing just 20 minutes
3. **Social support:** Find training partner or online community
4. **Variety:** Temporarily modify exercises for novelty
5. **Professional help:** Consider hiring a coach for accountability
