## Detailed Exercise Instructions

### Incline DB Press (3×8)
**Controlled Full Range of Motion Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Set incline bench to 30-45 degrees, sit with dumbbells resting on thighs
- **STARTING POSITION**: Lie back and position dumbbells at chest level, feet flat on floor
- **GRIP**: Hold dumbbells with palms facing forward, wrists straight and strong
- **DESCENT**: Lower weights slowly over 3 seconds, feel stretch in chest muscles
- **BOTTOM POSITION**: Lower until dumbbells are at chest level, elbows slightly below shoulders
- **PRESS**: Drive weights up and slightly together, focusing on chest muscle contraction
- **BREATHING**: Inhale during descent, exhale forcefully during pressing phase
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Builds upper body power for overhead serves and volleys
- **PROGRESSION**: Increase weight when you can complete all reps with perfect form

### Lat Pulldowns (3×10)
**Lat Engagement Focus Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Sit at lat pulldown machine, adjust thigh pads to secure legs
- **GRIP**: Use wide overhand grip, hands wider than shoulders on bar
- **STARTING POSITION**: Sit tall with slight lean back, chest up, shoulders down
- **PULL PHASE**: Pull bar down to upper chest, leading with elbows not hands
- **LAT FOCUS**: Think "pull elbows back and down" to target lats specifically
- **SQUEEZE**: Hold peak contraction for 1 second, feel lats working
- **RETURN**: Slowly return bar to start over 3 seconds, maintain tension
- **AVOID**: Don't lean back excessively or use momentum to move weight
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Strengthens pulling muscles for groundstroke power
- **PROGRESSION**: Increase weight when you can feel lats working throughout full range

### Band Pull-aparts (3×15)
**Consistent Tension Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Hold resistance band with both hands, arms extended in front at chest height
- **GRIP**: Hands shoulder-width apart on band, palms facing down
- **PULL**: Pull band apart by squeezing shoulder blades together
- **PEAK**: Pull until band touches chest, feel work in rear delts and rhomboids
- **TENSION**: Maintain constant tension in band throughout entire movement
- **RETURN**: Slowly return to start position, resist band's pull
- **POSTURE**: Keep shoulders down, don't shrug up during movement
- **BREATHING**: Exhale during pull apart, inhale during return
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Counters forward shoulder posture from tennis stance
- **PROGRESSION**: Use thicker band or wider grip when current becomes easy

### Mobility Prep (08:30–08:50)
**Shoulder and Wrist Preparation Instructions:**

**Shoulder Circles:**
- **SETUP**: Stand with arms at sides, relaxed shoulder position
- **SMALL CIRCLES**: Start with 10 small circles forward, 10 backward
- **LARGE CIRCLES**: Progress to 10 large arm circles each direction
- **CONTROL**: Smooth, controlled movement, feel shoulder joint warming up
- **PURPOSE**: Increases blood flow and range of motion for serves

**Wrist Circles:**
- **POSITION**: Extend arms forward, make fists with both hands
- **CIRCLES**: 10 circles each direction with both wrists simultaneously
- **RANGE**: Full range of motion, feel wrist joint loosening
- **PURPOSE**: Prepares wrists for racquet impact and control

**Band Stretches:**
- **SHOULDER DISLOCATES**: Hold band wide, slowly rotate arms overhead and behind back
- **EXTERNAL ROTATIONS**: Elbow at 90°, rotate forearm out against band resistance
- **INTERNAL ROTATIONS**: Rotate forearm in against band resistance
- **REPS**: 10-12 each movement, focus on smooth controlled motion
- **PURPOSE**: Activates rotator cuff muscles before tennis practice

### Tennis Serve & Volley Drills (09:00–10:00)
**Precision and Explosive Serves Instructions:**

**Serve Development:**
- **TOSS CONSISTENCY**: Practice 20 tosses without hitting, same spot every time

- **RECOVERY STEPS**: Quick small steps back to center court position
- **LATERAL MOVEMENT**: Wide shots with proper crossover and recovery
- **CONE DRILLS**: Use cones for precise footwork patterns

**Technical Refinement:**

- **GRIP CHECK**: Ensure proper grip for each stroke type
- **STANCE ANALYSIS**: Open vs closed stance for different situations
- **TIMING ADJUSTMENT**: Work on early preparation and contact point
