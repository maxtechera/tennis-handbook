## Detailed Exercise Instructions

### Tennis Power Baseline (07:15–08:15)
**Intensified Topspin and Cross-Court Drills:**
- **TOPSPIN SETUP**: Stand in ready position, racquet preparation with low-to-high swing path
- **CROSS-COURT FOCUS**: Target opposite diagonal court sections with consistent depth
- **FOOTWORK INTENSITY**: Active recovery steps after each shot, maintain athletic stance
- **POWER PROGRESSION**: Increase shot pace by 10-15% from Week 1 while maintaining 80% accuracy
- **DRILL PATTERN**: 20 forehands cross-court, 20 backhands cross-court, repeat for full hour
- **MOVEMENT EMPHASIS**: Wide shots with strong recovery, use proper hip rotation
- **SUCCESS METRIC**: 85% shots land in target zones with increased pace from Week 1

### Barbell Squat (4×8)
**Week 2 Progression Instructions:**
- **LOAD INCREASE**: Add 5-10% more weight than Week 1 (maintain perfect form priority)
- **SETUP**: Bar positioned on upper trapezius, feet hip-width apart, toes slightly out
- **DESCENT**: 3-second controlled lowering, feel the stretch in quadriceps and glutes
- **BOTTOM POSITION**: Thighs parallel or slightly below, pause for 1 second
- **EXPLOSIVE ASCENT**: Drive through heels explosively, extend hips and knees together
- **BREATHING**: Inhale at top, hold during descent, exhale forcefully during ascent
- **PROGRESSION FOCUS**: Weight increase with maintained tempo control

### Bulgarian Split Squat (3×10 per leg)
**Enhanced Control Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Rear foot elevated on bench 12-18 inches high, front foot 2-3 feet forward
- **WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION**: 90% weight on front leg, rear leg for balance only
- **CONTROLLED DESCENT**: Lower straight down over 2-3 seconds, feel front leg working
- **GLUTE ENGAGEMENT**: Focus on glute activation in front leg, avoid knee-dominant movement
- **DRIVE PHASE**: Push through front heel explosively to return to start
- **BALANCE**: If unstable, move closer to bench or lower elevation slightly
- **PROGRESSION**: Add light dumbbells (5-15 lbs) when bodyweight becomes easy

### Romanian Deadlift (3×8)
**Hip Hinge Pattern Instructions:**
- **STARTING POSITION**: Feet hip-width apart, barbell at hip level, slight knee bend
- **NEUTRAL SPINE**: Maintain natural lumbar curve throughout, chest up
- **HIP HINGE**: Push hips back first, lower bar by hinging at hips (not squatting down)
- **DESCENT**: Feel deep stretch in hamstrings, bar stays close to legs
- **RANGE**: Lower until hamstring flexibility limit, maintain flat back
- **ASCENT**: Drive hips forward to return to standing, squeeze glutes at top
- **MUSCLE FOCUS**: Hamstrings and glutes should do the work, not lower back

### Heavy Calf Raises (3×12)
**Slow Controlled Motion Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Stand on edge of platform with balls of feet on edge, heels hanging
- **WEIGHT**: Hold dumbbells or use calf raise machine for added resistance
- **ASCENT**: Rise up on toes slowly over 2 seconds, maximum height contraction
- **TOP HOLD**: Pause for 1 second at peak contraction, feel calf muscles squeeze
- **DESCENT**: Lower heels slowly over 3-4 seconds, stretch below platform level
- **RANGE**: Full range of motion from maximum stretch to maximum contraction
- **PROGRESSION**: Increase weight when you can complete all reps with control

### Spanish Squat (3×45 sec)
**Isometric Hold Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Resistance band around knees, back against wall, feet 12 inches from wall
- **POSITION**: Slide down wall until knees at 90 degrees, thighs parallel to floor
- **BAND TENSION**: Keep knees pushed out against band resistance throughout
- **MUSCLE ACTIVATION**: Contract quadriceps actively while maintaining position
- **BREATHING**: Deep, controlled breathing - never hold breath during isometric
- **PROGRESSION**: Week 2 increase from 30 seconds to 45 seconds hold time
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Builds knee stability for direction changes and jumping shots

### Pallof Press (3×12 per side)
**Anti-Rotation Core Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Cable set at chest height, stand perpendicular to machine
- **GRIP**: Hold handle with both hands at chest level, step away to create tension
- **STARTING POSITION**: Arms bent, handle at sternum, core engaged
- **PRESS OUT**: Extend arms straight out from chest, resist cable's pull to rotate you
- **HOLD**: Maintain straight arm position for 2 seconds, feel core working
- **RETURN**: Slowly bring handle back to chest with control
- **ANTI-ROTATION**: The challenge is preventing rotation - core must work to stay square
- **PROGRESSION**: Increase resistance or hold time when movement becomes easy

## Key Focus Points

- **Tennis**: Intensify topspin and cross-court drills with active footwork
- **Strength**: Increase load slightly from Week 1, focus on controlled descents and explosive ascents
- **Core Stability**: Maintain proper form during Spanish Squat isometric holds
- **Anti-Rotation**: Resist rotation during Pallof Press for core strength

## Notes

Week 2 progression focuses on building upon Week 1's foundation with slightly increased loads and intensity while maintaining proper form and technique.
