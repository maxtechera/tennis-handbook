## Enhanced Upper Body Strength (07:15-08:00)

### Primary Upper Body Movements

| Exercise                   | Sets√óReps | Rest    | HSR Protocol             | Specific Coaching Cues         |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Overhead Press (Tempo)** | 4√ó8       | 2.5 min | 3-sec eccentric lowering | "Lower bar to clavicle level"  |
|                            |           |         | 1-sec pause at bottom    | "Drive bar straight up"        |
|                            |           |         | Explosive concentric     | "Engage core, don't arch back" |
|                            |           |         | 65-70% estimated 1RM     | "Feel shoulders stabilizing"   |

**Overhead Press Detailed Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, barbell at shoulder level, grip slightly wider than shoulders
- **CORE ENGAGEMENT**: Brace core like someone is about to punch your stomach, maintain throughout lift
- **DESCENT**: Lower bar slowly over 3 seconds to just below chin level (clavicle), control the weight
- **PAUSE**: Hold briefly at bottom position, maintain tension in shoulders and core
- **DRIVE**: Press bar straight up explosively, drive through legs slightly, bar travels in straight line
- **BREATHING**: Inhale at top, hold breath during descent and press, exhale after completing rep
- **WEIGHT**: Use 65-70% of estimated 1RM (weight you could press for 3-5 max reps)
| **Cable/Band Row (HSR)**   | 4√ó10      | 2 min   | 4-sec eccentric emphasis | "Pull elbows back, not wide"   |
|                            |           |         | Squeeze shoulder blades  | "Feel rhomboids and mid-traps" |
|                            |           |         | Control the weight       | "Don't let weight slam down"   |
|                            |           |         | Focus on posture         | "Chest up, shoulders down"     |

**Cable/Band Row Detailed Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Sit with knees slightly bent, grab cable handle or resistance band, arms extended
- **POSTURE**: Sit tall with chest up, shoulders down and back, maintain neutral spine throughout
- **PULL PHASE**: Pull elbows straight back (not wide), lead with elbows, squeeze shoulder blades together
- **PEAK CONTRACTION**: Hold for 1 second at full contraction, feel the squeeze between shoulder blades
- **RETURN PHASE**: Slowly return to start over 4 full seconds, maintain tension throughout
- **MUSCLE FOCUS**: Target rhomboids and middle trapezius, avoid using momentum or body rock
- **COMMON ERRORS**: Don't round shoulders forward, don't pull with just arms, don't let weight slam down

### Shoulder Health & Activation

| Exercise               | Sets√óReps     | Instructions                           | Benefits                    |

| **Band Pull-aparts**   | 3√ó15          | Arms straight, pull band apart         | Rear deltoid strengthening  |
|                        |               | Focus on squeezing shoulder blades     | Postural improvement        |
| **External Rotations** | 3√ó15 each arm | Elbow at 90¬∞, slow controlled rotation | Rotator cuff strengthening  |
|                        |               | Feel the back of shoulder working      | Serve deceleration strength |

**Band Pull-aparts Detailed Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Hold resistance band with arms extended in front, hands shoulder-width apart
- **EXECUTION**: Pull band apart by squeezing shoulder blades together, arms stay straight
- **RANGE**: Pull until band touches chest, feel stretch across chest and work in rear delts
- **CONTROL**: Slowly return to start position, maintain tension in band throughout
- **FORM**: Keep shoulders down, don't shrug up, maintain good posture throughout movement

**External Rotations Detailed Instructions:**
- **POSITION**: Stand with elbow at 90 degrees, upper arm parallel to floor, forearm vertical
- **MOVEMENT**: Rotate forearm backward while keeping elbow in same position
- **RANGE**: Rotate as far as comfortable, feel work in back of shoulder (infraspinatus)
- **CONTROL**: 2 seconds out, 2 seconds back, focus on smooth controlled movement
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Strengthens muscles that slow down the arm during serve follow-through

**Detailed Tennis Preparation Instructions:**

**Shoulder Dislocates:**
- **SETUP**: Hold PVC pipe or resistance band with wide grip (wider than shoulder-width)
- **MOVEMENT**: Slowly rotate arms overhead and behind body, keeping arms straight
- **PROGRESSION**: Start with very wide grip, gradually narrow as mobility improves
- **CONTROL**: Never force the movement, stop if you feel pinching or pain
- **REPETITIONS**: 8-12 slow controlled repetitions, focus on smooth movement

**Arm Circles:**
- **SMALL CIRCLES**: Start with 6-inch diameter circles, arms at shoulder height
- **PROGRESSION**: Gradually increase to large circles (arm's length diameter)
- **DIRECTION**: 15 seconds forward, 15 seconds backward for each size
- **FOCUS**: Feel the shoulder joint warming up, increasing blood flow

**Wrist Preparation:**
- **CIRCLES**: 10 each direction, both wrists simultaneously
- **FLEXOR STRETCH**: Arm extended, palm up, gently pull fingers back for 15 seconds
- **EXTENSOR STRETCH**: Arm extended, palm down, gently push hand down for 15 seconds
- **TENNIS FOCUS**: Prepares wrists for impact and racquet control

**Rotator Cuff Activation:**
- **EXTERNAL ROTATION**: Light band, elbow at 90¬∞, rotate out against resistance
- **INTERNAL ROTATION**: Rotate arm in against resistance
- **REPS**: 12-15 each direction, focus on quality over speed
- **PURPOSE**: Activates stabilizing muscles before serve practice

**Medicine Ball Chest Pass:**
