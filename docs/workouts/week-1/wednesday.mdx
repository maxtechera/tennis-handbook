| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **DB Bench Press (Velocity)** | 4√ó8       | 2.5 min | Fast concentric (0.8-1.0 m/s) | Chest, shoulders, triceps  |
|                               |           |         | Controlled 2-sec eccentric    | Power development          |
|                               |           |         | Focus on bar speed            | Neural adaptations         |
|                               |           |         | 70-75% estimated 1RM          | Strength-power combination |

**DB Bench Press Detailed Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Lie on bench with dumbbells at chest level, feet flat on floor, slight arch in lower back
- **GRIP**: Hold dumbbells with palms facing forward, wrists straight and strong
- **DESCENT**: Lower weights over 2 full seconds, control the weight down to chest level
- **BOTTOM POSITION**: Feel stretch in chest muscles, dumbbells should be just above chest
- **EXPLOSIVE DRIVE**: Press weights up as fast as possible while maintaining control
- **VELOCITY FOCUS**: Aim for fast but controlled upward movement (like pushing someone away)
- **BREATHING**: Inhale during descent, exhale forcefully during explosive upward phase
- **WEIGHT**: Use 70-75% of estimated 1RM (weight you could press for 3-5 max reps)
| **Bent-over DB Row**          | 4√ó8       | 2 min   | Squeeze at top for 1 second   | Rhomboids, mid-traps, lats |
|                               |           |         | Control negative slowly       | Postural strength          |
|                               |           |         | Feel muscles working          | Balanced development       |
|                               |           |         | Maintain flat back            | Core stability integration |

**Bent-over DB Row Detailed Instructions:**
- **SETUP**: Feet hip-width apart, hinge at hips with slight knee bend, dumbbells hanging straight down
- **BACK POSITION**: Maintain flat back throughout, chest up, eyes looking slightly ahead
- **PULL PHASE**: Pull dumbbells toward lower ribs, lead with elbows, squeeze shoulder blades together
- **TOP POSITION**: Hold for 1 full second at top, feel the squeeze between shoulder blades
- **LOWERING**: Control the weight down slowly over 2-3 seconds, maintain upper back tension
- **MUSCLE FOCUS**: Feel the work in your upper back muscles, not just your arms
- **FORM CHECK**: If you can't maintain flat back, reduce weight or elevate torso angle
- **BREATHING**: Exhale during pull phase, inhale during lowering phase

### PAP (Post-Activation Potentiation) Introduction

| Complex       | Exercise               | Sets√óReps | Rest  | Instructions                 | Benefits              |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Complex 1** | Landmine Press (Heavy) | 3√ó6       | -     | 80% effort, explosive intent | Strength conditioning |
|               | ‚Üí Med Ball Slam        | 3√ó4       | 3 min | 20s after press, max speed   | Power expression      |
|               |                        |           |       | Full overhead extension      | Neural potentiation   |

**PAP Complex Detailed Instructions:**

**Landmine Press (Heavy):**
- **SETUP**: One end of barbell in landmine base or corner, load other end with weight
- **STANCE**: Stagger stance, hold barbell at shoulder level with both hands
- **EXECUTION**: Press barbell up and slightly forward at 45-degree angle
- **INTENSITY**: Use 80% effort - challenging but you could do 2-3 more reps
- **EXPLOSIVE INTENT**: Focus on pressing as fast as possible even if movement is slow
- **REST**: Immediately rest 20 seconds to allow nervous system to prepare for power work

**Medicine Ball Slam:**
- **TIMING**: Begin exactly 20 seconds after completing landmine press set
- **SETUP**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hold med ball overhead with both hands
- **EXECUTION**: Slam ball down as hard as possible using whole body, engage core
- **POWER FOCUS**: Maximum speed and force - this is where you express the power
- **RETRIEVAL**: Pick up ball quickly and repeat for all 4 reps without pause
- **PURPOSE**: The heavy landmine press "primes" your nervous system for explosive power in the slams

### Pull & Posterior Chain

| Exercise                  | Sets√óReps | Instructions                   | Progression Goal            |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Neutral-grip Pull-ups** | 3√óAMRAP   | Track total reps weekly        | +1-2 reps per week          |
|                           |           | Controlled descent             | Progression: 25+ total reps |
|                           |           | Full extension at bottom       | Eventually weighted reps    |
| **Face-pulls**            | 3√ó12      | Elbows high, external rotation | Shoulder health maintenance |
|                           |           | Slow and controlled            | Rear deltoid emphasis       |

**Pull & Posterior Chain Detailed Instructions:**

**Neutral-grip Pull-ups:**
- **GRIP**: Use neutral grip (palms facing each other) if available, or underhand grip
- **STARTING POSITION**: Hang with arms fully extended, shoulders engaged (not completely relaxed)
- **PULL PHASE**: Pull chest toward bar, lead with chest not chin, squeeze shoulder blades
- **TOP POSITION**: Get chin over bar, hold briefly at top, feel full lat and rhomboid contraction
- **DESCENT**: Lower slowly and controlled over 2-3 seconds, resist gravity
- **FULL EXTENSION**: Return to arms fully extended but maintain slight shoulder engagement
- **AMRAP**: Do as many reps as possible with perfect form, stop when form breaks down
- **PROGRESSION**: Track total reps across all 3 sets, aim to add 1-2 reps weekly

**Face-pulls:**
- **SETUP**: Set cable at face height or use resistance band attached to sturdy anchor
- **GRIP**: Hold rope/band with overhand grip, arms extended forward
- **PULL PHASE**: Pull elbows back and up to shoulder height, separate hands apart
- **EXTERNAL ROTATION**: As you pull back, rotate forearms so palms face forward
- **PEAK**: Squeeze shoulder blades together, feel work in rear delts and rhomboids
- **RETURN**: Slowly return to start position maintaining tension throughout
- **FOCUS**: Think "pull apart and back" - this counters forward shoulder posture

## Metabolic Conditioning Finisher (09:35-09:50)

### High-Intensity Circuit

| Round       | Exercise     | Work Time | Rest | Intensity | Focus               |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ---- | --------- | ------------------- |
| **Round 1** | Battle Ropes | 20s       | 20s  | 9/10 RPE  | Full body power     |
|             | KB Swings    | 20s       | 60s  | 8/10 RPE  | Hip drive           |
| **Round 2** | Battle Ropes | 20s       | 20s  | 9/10 RPE  | Maintain intensity  |
|             | KB Swings    | 20s       | 60s  | 8/10 RPE  | Technical precision |
| **Round 3** | Battle Ropes | 20s       | 20s  | 9/10 RPE  | Mental toughness    |
|             | KB Swings    | 20s       | 60s  | 8/10 RPE  | Finish strong       |

**Coaching Cues:**
- Battle Ropes: "Slam down hard, engage core"
- KB Swings: "Hip drive, not squat motion"
- Monitor form degradation

**Metabolic Conditioning Detailed Instructions:**

**Battle Ropes:**
- **SETUP**: Grab one rope in each hand, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, slight athletic stance
- **MOVEMENT**: Alternate slamming ropes down as hard as possible, use whole body
- **CORE ENGAGEMENT**: Keep core tight throughout, don't let ropes pull you forward
- **INTENSITY**: Go all-out for 20 seconds - this should be maximum effort
- **FORM**: Maintain good posture, don't round shoulders forward
- **BREATHING**: Breathe forcefully - don't hold breath during high intensity

**Kettlebell Swings:**
- **SETUP**: Stand with feet wider than shoulders, kettlebell on ground between feet
- **GRIP**: Hinge at hips, grab kettlebell with both hands, maintain flat back
- **HIP DRIVE**: Explosively drive hips forward to swing kettlebell to eye level
- **CONTROL**: Let kettlebell swing back between legs, hinge at hips (not squat down)
- **RHYTHM**: Smooth, powerful rhythm - not rushed or jerky movements
- **LANDING**: Kettlebell should "float" at top, let gravity bring it down naturally
- **FOCUS**: All power comes from hips and glutes, arms just guide the weight
