- **PROGRESSION**: Once mastered, can increase box height slightly

**Lateral Bounds:**
- **STARTING POSITION**: Stand on one leg with slight knee bend, arms ready
- **BOUND**: Explosively push off laterally with outside leg, drive with arms
- **FLIGHT**: Aim for maximum distance sideways, not just up
- **LANDING**: Land on opposite leg, absorb impact, stick the landing
- **CONTROL**: Hold landing position for 1-2 seconds before next rep
- **ALTERNATION**: Bound right, land left, then bound left, land right
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Trains lateral court coverage power

**Medicine Ball Slam + Jump:**
- **STARTING**: Hold med ball overhead with both hands, feet hip-width apart
- **SLAM**: Explosively slam ball down with full body engagement
- **IMMEDIATE JUMP**: As ball hits ground, immediately jump up vertically
- **RETRIEVAL**: Land, quickly grab ball, and set up for next rep
- **CONTINUOUS**: No rest between slam and jump - trains power endurance
- **INTENSITY**: Maintain maximum effort throughout all 6 reps

**Power Development Goals:**
- Maximum effort on every rep
- Perfect landing mechanics
- Progressive improvement in distance/height
- Maintain quality throughout all sets
