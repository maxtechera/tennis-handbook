## Enhanced Aerobic Development (07:30-08:20)

### Cardiovascular Base Building

| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Zone-2 Intervals | 4√ó3 min     | 65-75% HRmax      | Aerobic base development | Nasal breathing only      |

### Core Integration Training

| Exercise               | Sets√óReps    | Instructions               | Tennis Benefits             |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Hanging Leg Raises** | 3√ó12         | Controlled lift, no swing  | Core strength for serves    |
|                        |              | Focus on lower abdominals  | Improved serve power        |
|                        |              | 2-sec hold at top          | Enhanced court movement     |
| **Dead Bug + Reach**   | 3√ó8 per side | Opposite arm/leg extension | Core stability coordination |
|                        |              | Maintain flat back         | Reduced back injury risk    |
|                        |              | Slow, controlled movement  | Better movement efficiency  |

**Core Integration Detailed Instructions:**

**Hanging Leg Raises:**
- **SETUP**: Hang from pull-up bar with overhand grip, arms fully extended, body straight
- **STARTING POSITION**: Let legs hang straight down, engage core to prevent swaying
- **LIFT PHASE**: Slowly raise knees toward chest by contracting lower abdominals
- **TOP POSITION**: Bring knees as high as possible (ideally to chest level), hold for 2 seconds
- **LOWERING**: Control the descent slowly over 3-4 seconds, resist gravity
- **FORM CHECK**: No swinging or using momentum - all movement from core muscles
- **PROGRESSION**: If too difficult, start with bent knee raises; if easy, progress to straight leg raises
- **BREATHING**: Exhale during lift phase, inhale during lowering

**Dead Bug + Reach:**
- **SETUP**: Lie on back, arms extended toward ceiling, knees bent at 90 degrees
- **STARTING POSITION**: Press lower back flat against floor, engage core muscles
- **MOVEMENT**: Slowly extend opposite arm overhead and opposite leg straight
- **EXTENSION**: Arm reaches back toward floor, leg extends until heel nearly touches ground
- **CONTROL**: Move arm and leg simultaneously, maintain core stability throughout
- **RETURN**: Slowly bring arm and leg back to starting position with control
- **ALTERNATION**: Complete all reps on one side, then switch to other arm/leg combination
- **CORE FOCUS**: Never let lower back arch off the floor - this is the key challenge

**Tennis-Specific Tendon Health Detailed Instructions:**

**Side Plank + Clamshells:**
- **SIDE PLANK SETUP**: Lie on side, forearm on ground perpendicular to body, body in straight line
- **ALIGNMENT**: Stack hips, shoulders, and feet - no sagging or pike position
- **HOLD**: Maintain perfect position for 30 seconds, breathe normally throughout
- **CLAMSHELL TRANSITION**: Immediately after plank, bend knees 90 degrees, keep feet together
- **CLAMSHELL MOVEMENT**: Lift top knee up while keeping feet together, feel glute activation
- **REPETITIONS**: 10 clamshells with control, focus on glute working not hip flexor
- **PROGRESSION**: Once easy, add single-arm reach during plank hold
- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Builds hip stability for wide defensive shots and lateral movement

**Calf Raise + Tibialis:**
- **CALF RAISE SETUP**: Stand on edge of step with balls of feet on step, heels hanging off
- **CALF RAISE EXECUTION**: Rise up on toes as high as possible, hold 1 second at top
- **ECCENTRIC FOCUS**: Lower heels slowly over 3 full seconds below step level
- **RANGE**: Full stretch at bottom, maximum contraction at top
- **TIBIALIS SETUP**: Stand with heels on step, toes hanging off (opposite position)
- **TIBIALIS EXECUTION**: Lift toes up toward shins as high as possible, hold briefly
- **CONTROL**: Lower toes slowly, feel work in front of shins (tibialis anterior)
- **PROGRESSION**: Add weight vest or dumbbells when bodyweight becomes easy
