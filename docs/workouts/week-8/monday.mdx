# Monday – Advanced Methods & Neural Development

## Monday Schedule (Advanced Methods Phase)

| Time | Exercise/Drill | Sets×Reps | Instructions |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| 07:15–08:15 | Tennis Neural Sharpening | - | High-speed drills, reaction training |
| 08:25–09:35 | Velocity-Based Training | | |
| | Back Squat (VBT) | 5×3 @ 90% | Bar velocity >0.5 m/s |
| | Jump Squat | 4×3 @ 30% | Maximum velocity intent |
| | Single-Leg RDL | 3×5 per leg | Heavy, controlled |
| | Depth Jumps | 4×3 | 18" box, reactive |
| 09:35–09:50 | Neural Recovery | - | Breathing, light mobility |

## Quick Exercise Instructions (Advanced Methods)

**VBT Back Squat**: Use velocity tracker, maintain >0.5 m/s bar speed at 90% load

**Jump Squat**: Light load (30%), focus on maximum velocity and acceleration

**Single-Leg RDL**: Heavy loading progression, maintain balance and control

**Depth Jumps**: 18-inch box, focus on minimal ground contact time

**Tennis Neural Sharpening**: High-speed reaction drills, cognitive challenges

**Velocity Focus**: All movements prioritize speed and neural drive over load
