## Velocity Aerobic Session

### Neural Activation (12 minutes)
- Velocity-specific warm-up
- Fast dynamic movements
- Central nervous system priming
- Movement velocity preparation

### Main Training - Velocity-Based Aerobic (40 minutes)

**Velocity Intervals:**
- High-Velocity Bike Sprints: 8×10 seconds @ maximum
- Active Recovery: 2 minutes between sprints
- Focus on peak power output

**Velocity Core Training:**
- Speed Dead Bugs: 4×6 each side (fast tempo)
- Quick Plank Transitions: 4×30 seconds
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

**Tennis Velocity Integration:**
- Reaction Sprints: 6×5 seconds
- Quick Direction Changes: 6×3 each direction
- Rest: Full recovery between sets

### Velocity Recovery (8 minutes)
- Gradual velocity reduction
- Controlled breathing
- Movement quality focus

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### High-Velocity Bike Sprints (8×10 sec)
- Maximum effort for 10 seconds
- Focus on peak power output
- 2 minutes full recovery between sprints
- Monitor power/velocity if available
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Cardio Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0ht3ow8TQ)

### Speed Dead Bugs
- Fast but controlled arm/leg extensions
- Focus on movement velocity
- Maintain core stability
- Quick tempo with good form
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Abs Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdOuqokcm4)

### Quick Plank Transitions
- Move between plank variations quickly
- Side plank to front plank transitions
- Focus on speed and stability
- 30 seconds of continuous movement
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Core Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdOuqokcm4)

### Reaction Sprints
- Wait for stimulus then sprint maximally
- 5-second all-out efforts
- Focus on reaction time
- Simulate tennis reaction demands
- Full recovery between efforts

### Quick Direction Changes
- Rapid lateral and linear direction changes
- 3 changes each direction
- Focus on acceleration and deceleration
- Tennis-specific movement patterns
- Maintain balance and control

## Performance Notes
- **Velocity Focus**: Maximum speed and power emphasis
- **Neural Training**: High-quality, low-volume approach
- **Recovery Quality**: Full recovery between high-intensity efforts
- **Tennis Application**: Direct transfer to court velocity demands
