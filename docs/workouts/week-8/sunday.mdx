# Sunday - Week 8

_Advanced Methods Phase - Neural Recovery_

## Advanced Methods Recovery Protocol

### Recovery & Nutrition Week 8 (Velocity Phase)
- **Protein**: 2.0-2.2 g/kg for neural adaptations
- **Hydration**: 2.5-3 liters daily with electrolytes
- **Sleep**: 8-9 hours for neural recovery
- **Neural Recovery**: Focus on cognitive restoration

## Quick Recovery Instructions

### Neural Yoga (30 minutes)
- Focus on mind-body connection
- Slow, controlled movements
- Neural recovery emphasis
- Balance and coordination poses
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Mobility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wPpK6xW9s8)

### Cognitive Walk (30 minutes)
- Easy pace with mental focus
- Practice mindfulness during walk
- Recovery from velocity training
- Neural system restoration
- Fresh air and mental clarity

### Neural Recovery Rolling (20 minutes)
- Focus on areas stressed by velocity work
- Include neck and upper back
- Gentle approach for neural recovery
- Prepare for complex training phase
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Recovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wPpK6xW9s8)

### Cognitive Breathwork (15 minutes)
- Focus on mental clarity
- Breathing patterns for neural recovery
- Recovery from high cognitive demands
- Prepare for complex training
- Mental restoration priority

### Velocity Assessment
- Review velocity training adaptations
- Note neural and physical improvements
- Mental preparation for complex phase
- Plan for multi-system training
- Assess velocity development

## Key Focus Points
- **Neural Recovery**: High cognitive demands require rest
- **Mental Clarity**: Focus on cognitive restoration
- **Preparation**: Ready for complex training phase
- **Assessment**: Evaluate velocity training progress
