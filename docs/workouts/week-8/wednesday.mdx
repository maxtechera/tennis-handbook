## Velocity-Based Training Session

### Neural Activation (15 minutes)
- Fast dynamic movements
- Velocity preparation drills
- Central nervous system priming
- Movement quality focus

### Main Training - VBT Protocol (45 minutes)

**Speed-Strength Focus:**
- Bench Press: 5×3 @ 60-70% 1RM (0.8-1.0 m/s target)
- Speed Row: 5×3 @ 60% 1RM (maximum velocity)
- Rest: 2-3 minutes between sets

**Power-Speed Focus:**
- Medicine Ball Chest Pass: 4×4 (maximum velocity)
- Speed Push-ups: 4×4 (explosive focus)
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

**Velocity Endurance:**
- Band Speed Punches: 3×15 seconds
- Fast Pull-aparts: 3×20 reps
- Rest: 60 seconds between sets

### Recovery (15 minutes)
- Velocity deceleration
- Controlled breathing
- Light mobility

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Bench Press (VBT)
- Use 60-70% of your 1RM
- Focus on maximum bar speed
- Lower with control
- Explode up as fast as possible
- Stop set if velocity drops significantly

### Speed Row
- Light-moderate load (60% 1RM)
- Pull with maximum velocity
- Focus on acceleration
- Quick turnaround at top
- Maintain perfect form

### Medicine Ball Chest Pass
- Partner or wall 4-5 feet away
- Explosive chest pass release
- Focus on hand speed
- Catch and immediately repeat
- Maximum velocity each rep

### Speed Push-ups
- Standard push-up position
- Lower with control
- Explode up with maximum speed
- Quality over quantity
- Rest between reps if needed

### Band Speed Punches
- Light resistance band
- Alternate rapid punches
- Maximum frequency for time
- Keep core engaged
- Focus on speed, not power

## Performance Notes
- **Velocity Focus**: Speed of movement is priority
- **Load Management**: Lighter loads for maximum velocity
- **Quality Control**: Stop when velocity drops
- **Neural Training**: High-quality, low-fatigue approach
