## Velocity Power Session

### Neural Velocity Warm-up (15 minutes)
- High-frequency movements
- Velocity-specific preparation
- Central nervous system optimization
- Movement speed activation

### Main Training - Velocity-Based Power (60 minutes)

**Tennis Velocity Agility:**
- Speed Court Drills: 20 minutes
- Maximum velocity movements
- Quick direction changes
- Reaction time training

**VBT Strength-Power:**
- VBT Deadlifts: 6×4 @ 60-70% (0.8+ m/s)
- → Speed Bounds: 6×4 (maximum velocity)
- Rest: 3 minutes (full neural recovery)

**Velocity Hip Power:**
- VBT Hip Thrusts: 5×5 @ 60% (max velocity)
- → Quick Broad Jumps: 5×4
- Rest: 2 minutes between sets

**Upper Velocity Power:**
- Speed Push Press: 5×5 @ 50-60% (max velocity)
- → Fast Medicine Ball Throws: 5×6
- Rest: 2 minutes between sets

**Velocity Endurance:**
- Speed Farmer's Carry: 4×30m (fast pace)
- Quick Plyometric Circuit: 4×40 seconds
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

### Velocity Recovery (15 minutes)
- Gradual velocity reduction
- Movement quality focus
- Neural recovery protocols

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### VBT Deadlifts (60-70% @ 0.8+ m/s)
- Lighter load than strength focus
- Maximum bar speed on every rep
- Monitor velocity if possible
- Stop set if velocity drops significantly
- Focus on acceleration phase
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Deadlift Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op9kVnSso6Q)

### Speed Bounds
- Maximum velocity bounds
- Focus on speed over distance
- Quick ground contact
- Rapid turnaround between bounds
- Express velocity from deadlifts
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Plyometric Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcY1dI5-Teo)

### VBT Hip Thrusts (60% max velocity)
- Light load for maximum speed
- Explosive hip drive velocity
- Focus on acceleration
- Quick tempo throughout
- Neural drive emphasis
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Hip Thrust Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDmFkJxPzeM)

### Speed Push Press (50-60%)
- Light load for maximum velocity
- Explosive leg drive and press
- Focus on bar speed
- Quick reset between reps
- Neural power development
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Push Press Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaBVSJm78ko)

### Fast Medicine Ball Throws
- Light to moderate medicine ball
- Maximum throwing velocity
- Various angles and directions
- Quick reset between throws
- Express velocity from press
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Power Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8aGBKy3a1k)

### Speed Farmer's Carry
- Moderate load carried quickly
- Fast walking pace
- Maintain posture at speed
- Quick turnaround
- Velocity under load
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Farmer's Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8FWv6bUJ7w)

## Performance Notes
- **Velocity Focus**: Speed of movement prioritized over load
- **Load Management**: 50-70% loads for maximum velocity
- **Neural Training**: High-quality, velocity-specific adaptations
- **Recovery Quality**: Full recovery for velocity maintenance
