# Saturday - Week 8

_Advanced Methods Phase - Velocity Application_

## Saturday Options

### Option A: Velocity Match Play (Recommended)
- **Velocity Warm-up**: 15 minutes speed-focused preparation
- **High-Velocity Match**: Apply velocity training in competition
- **Velocity Recovery**: Quick, efficient recovery protocols

### Option B: Velocity Conditioning
- **Speed Intervals**: 20 minutes velocity-based conditioning
- **Quick Mobility**: 15 minutes fast-paced stretching
- **Neural Recovery**: 10 minutes cognitive rest

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Velocity Warm-up
- 15 minutes speed-focused preparation
- Fast dynamic movements
- Quick acceleration drills
- Mental preparation for velocity application
- Neural system activation
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Warm-up Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wPpK6xW9s8)

### Speed Intervals (No Match Day)
- 8Ã—30 seconds high-speed movement
- Can be running, cycling, or court drills
- 90 seconds recovery between intervals
- Focus on maximum velocity
- Apply velocity training principles
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Cardio Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0ht3ow8TQ)
