## Match Simulation Session

### Pre-Match Warm-up (12 minutes)
- Match-specific preparation
- Movement pattern activation
- Mental readiness protocols
- Competition mindset development

### Main Training - Match Simulation (40 minutes)

**Match Pace Intervals:**
- Game Simulation: 5×3 minutes @ match intensity
- Set Break Recovery: 90 seconds between
- Simulate actual match demands

**Competition Core Work:**
- Match Stability: 3×45 seconds (game-like positions)
- Competition Breathing: 3×30 seconds
- Rest: Match-like timing

**Match Movement Patterns:**
- Point Simulation: 8×20 seconds (full court)
- Competition Recovery: 25 seconds between points
- Match-like intensity and timing

### Post-Match Recovery (8 minutes)
- Competition cool-down routine
- Mental decompression
- Recovery protocol practice

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Game Simulation (5×3 min)
- Intensity matching typical game demands
- 3 minutes continuous moderate-high effort
- 90 seconds recovery (like set breaks)
- Simulate physical demands of tennis games
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Cardio Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0ht3ow8TQ)

### Match Stability
- Hold positions similar to tennis stances
- 45 seconds of stability work
- May include single-leg or dynamic holds
- Focus on match-relevant stability
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Core Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdOuqokcm4)

### Competition Breathing
- Practice breathing patterns for competition
- 30 seconds of controlled breathing
- Focus on calming and centering
- Develop pre-point breathing routine
- Important for competition mental state

### Point Simulation
- 20-second high-intensity movement
- Simulate full tennis point demands
- Include acceleration, deceleration, direction changes
- 25 seconds recovery (match timing)
- Match-level intensity required

### Competition Recovery
- Practice between-point recovery routines
- 25 seconds active recovery
- Develop consistent recovery patterns
- Mental reset during recovery time
- Prepare for next point simulation

## Performance Notes
- **Match Specificity**: Training mimics competition demands
- **Timing Practice**: Realistic work-to-rest ratios
- **Mental Training**: Competition mindset development
- **Reduced Volume**: Maintain fitness without overreaching
