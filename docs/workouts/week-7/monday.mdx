# Monday – Lower Body Power & Baseline Explosiveness

## Monday Schedule

| Time | Exercise/Drill | Sets×Reps | Instructions |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| 07:15‑08:15 | Tennis – Reactive Baseline | 4×6‑ball burst rally | Explode to first step, active split‑step |
| 08:25‑09:30 | Back‑squat (cluster) | 4×(3+2) @ 85% | 3 reps, 15s rest, then 2 reps. Focus bar speed |
| | Rear‑foot elevated jump lunge | 3×5/leg | Body‑weight, minimal ground contact |
| | Stiff‑leg RDL | 3×6 | Heavy but crisp; 2s eccentric |
| | Standing calf ISO | 3×30s | Mid‑foot hold, breathe slowly |
| 09:30‑09:50 | Spanish squat iso + Cable wood‑chop | 2×45s / 2×12/side | Maintain trunk stiffness |

## Quick Exercise Instructions (Intensification Phase)

**Back-squat Cluster (4×(3+2))**: 3 reps at 85%, rest 15s, then 2 more reps - focus on bar speed

**Rear-foot Elevated Jump Lunge**: Explosive jump between legs, minimal ground contact time

**Stiff-leg RDL (Heavy)**: 2-second eccentric, heavy load, maintain leg position throughout

**Standing Calf ISO**: Hold mid-range position for 30s, focus on controlled breathing

**Tennis Reactive Baseline**: 6-ball burst rallies with explosive first steps

**Cluster Focus**: Power development through rest-pause training methodology

## Key Focus Points

- **Reactive Tennis**: Explosive baseline with burst rallies and active split-steps
- **Cluster Training**: Back squat clusters for power development
- **Jump Training**: Rear-foot elevated jump lunges with minimal ground contact
- **Heavy RDLs**: Crisp execution with controlled eccentric
- **Core Power**: Cable wood-chops for rotational strength

## Notes

Week 7 emphasizes power conversion while maintaining peak strength with reduced volume.
