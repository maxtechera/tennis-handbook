## Complex Multi-Planar Session

### Multi-Planar Warm-up (15 minutes)
- Sagittal plane movements
- Frontal plane activation
- Transverse plane preparation
- Power movement priming

### Main Training - Multi-Planar Complexes (50 minutes)

**Complex 1: Sagittal Plane Power**
- Bench Press: 4×3 @ 80% (sagittal strength)
- Forward Med Ball Slam: 4×4 (sagittal power)
- Rest: 3 minutes

**Complex 2: Frontal Plane Power**
- Lateral Raise (Heavy): 4×3 @ 80% (frontal strength)
- Lateral Med Ball Slam: 4×4 each side (frontal power)
- Rest: 3 minutes

**Complex 3: Transverse Plane Power**
- Cable Wood Chop: 4×3 @ heavy (rotational strength)
- Rotational Med Ball Throw: 4×4 each side (rotational power)
- Rest: 3 minutes

### Integration (10 minutes)
- Multi-planar movement patterns
- Tennis-specific integration
- Recovery breathing

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Forward Med Ball Slam
- Hold ball overhead with both hands
- Slam straight down with maximum force
- Use entire body in sagittal plane
- Quick retrieval and reset
- Express forward power

### Lateral Med Ball Slam
- Hold ball at shoulder height
- Slam to one side with rotation
- Use core and shoulders maximally
- Alternate sides or complete one side
- Express lateral power

### Cable Wood Chop (Heavy)
- Set cable high or low
- Pull across body diagonally
- Control both directions
- Feel core and shoulders working
- Heavy resistance for strength

### Rotational Med Ball Throw
- Stand sideways to wall
- Hold ball at hip level
- Rotate and throw explosively
- Catch rebound quickly
- Express rotational power from wood chop

### Lateral Raise (Heavy)
- Hold dumbbells at sides
- Raise laterally to shoulder height
- Control both up and down
- Heavy load for strength component
- Focus on deltoid strength

## Performance Notes
- **Multi-Planar**: Training all three planes of movement
- **Tennis Application**: Direct transfer to court movements
- **Complex Method**: Strength + power in each plane
- **Integration**: Combine all planes at end
