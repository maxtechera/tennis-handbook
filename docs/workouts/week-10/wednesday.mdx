## Neural Sharpening Session

### Reaction Activation (12 minutes)
- Reaction ball drills
- Visual stimulus response
- Audio cue training
- Neural pathway activation

### Main Training - Precision Power (35 minutes)

**Precision Strength Circuit:**
- Tempo Bench Press: 4×3 (3-1-X-1 tempo)
- Precision Push-ups: 4×3 (perfect form)
- Rest: 90 seconds

**Reaction Power Circuit:**
- Reactive Med Ball Catch & Throw: 4×5
- Partner Signal Push-ups: 4×5
- Rest: 90 seconds

**Neural Endurance Circuit:**
- Band Reaction Pulls: 3×10 each direction
- Quick Direction Changes: 3×15 seconds
- Rest: 60 seconds

### Neural Recovery (8 minutes)
- Slow controlled movements
- Deep breathing exercises
- Visual focus training

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Tempo Bench Press (3-1-X-1)
- 3 seconds down (eccentric)
- 1 second pause at chest
- Explosive up (concentric)
- 1 second pause at top
- Perfect precision required

### Reactive Med Ball Catch & Throw
- Partner throws ball at random times
- React and catch quickly
- Immediately throw back
- Focus on reaction speed
- Train neural response time

### Partner Signal Push-ups
- Start in push-up position
- Wait for partner's signal
- Perform push-up immediately
- Return to ready position
- Train reaction to stimulus

### Band Reaction Pulls
- Hold band with partner
- React to partner's direction cues
- Pull in indicated direction
- Quick directional changes
- Train multi-directional reactions

### Quick Direction Changes
- Start in athletic position
- React to visual/audio cues
- Change direction quickly
- Maintain balance and control
- Simulate tennis reaction demands

## Performance Notes
- **Neural Focus**: Reaction time and precision training
- **Quality Priority**: Perfect execution over speed
- **Reaction Training**: Unpredictable stimulus response
- **Tennis Transfer**: Direct application to court reactions
