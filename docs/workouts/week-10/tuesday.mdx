## Speed & Power Session

### Neural Activation (10 minutes)
- Rapid arm swings
- Fast feet drills
- Reaction ball work
- Explosive clap push-ups (3 x 3)

### Main Training - Neural Speed Work (30 minutes)

**Speed Circuit 1: Upper Body Velocity**
- Medicine Ball Chest Pass: 4 x 3 (maximum speed)
- Speed Band Punches: 4 x 10 seconds
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

**Speed Circuit 2: Rotational Speed**
- Cable Speed Chops: 4 x 5 each side (light weight, max speed)
- Reaction Ball Slams: 4 x 3
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

**Speed Circuit 3: Neural Activation**
- Plyo Push-up to Sprint: 3 x 1 + 10m
- Band-Resisted Arm Drive: 3 x 15 seconds
- Rest: 2 minutes between sets

### Cool-down (10 minutes)
- Light dynamic movements
- Neural breathing exercises
- Joint mobility

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Medicine Ball Chest Pass
- Partner or wall 3-4 feet away
- Hold ball at chest level
- Explosively push ball forward
- Focus on hand speed, not power
- Catch and immediately repeat

### Speed Band Punches
- Attach light bands to fixed point
- Alternate rapid punches
- Focus on speed, not range
- Keep core tight
- Maximum frequency for time

### Cable Speed Chops
- Use light weight (30% normal)
- Set cable at shoulder height
- Perform chops as fast as possible
- Maintain good form
- Focus on acceleration

### Plyo Push-up to Sprint
- Perform one explosive push-up
- Immediately jump to feet
- Sprint 10 meters at max speed
- Walk back and reset
- Quality over quantity

### Band-Resisted Arm Drive
- Bands attached behind you
- Drive arms as if sprinting
- Maximum frequency
- Stay on balls of feet
- Maintain sprinting posture

## Performance Notes
- **Neural Focus**: All movements at maximum velocity
- **Rest Quality**: Full neural recovery between sets
- **Load**: Light weights, focus on speed
- **Mental State**: High alertness and focus required
