## Cognitive Aerobic Session

### Mental Activation (10 minutes)
- Cognitive warm-up exercises
- Decision-making preparation
- Visual tracking drills
- Mental focus activation

### Main Training - Cognitive-Aerobic Integration (35 minutes)

**Cognitive Bike Training:**
- Decision Intervals: 6×2 minutes
- Visual cues during cycling
- Make decisions while maintaining effort
- 90 seconds recovery between intervals

**Cognitive Core Training:**
- Pattern Dead Bugs: 4×6 each (follow visual patterns)
- Reaction Planks: 4×30 seconds (respond to cues)
- Rest: 60 seconds between sets

**Tennis Cognitive Integration:**
- Decision Sprints: 6×10 seconds (react to signals)
- Cognitive Direction Changes: 6×5 changes
- Rest: Full recovery for mental clarity

### Cognitive Recovery (10 minutes)
- Mental decompression
- Slow controlled movements
- Focus restoration exercises

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Decision Intervals (6×2 min)
- Maintain steady cycling effort
- Respond to visual or audio cues during exercise
- Make quick decisions while exercising
- Trains brain-body coordination
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Cardio Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0ht3ow8TQ)

### Pattern Dead Bugs
- Follow visual pattern cues for arm/leg movement
- Maintain core stability while processing information
- Combines cognitive load with physical exercise
- Focus on accuracy and control
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Abs Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdOuqokcm4)

### Reaction Planks
- Hold plank while responding to external cues
- May involve arm/leg movements on command
- 30 seconds with cognitive challenges
- Maintain plank stability throughout
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Core Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdOuqokcm4)

### Decision Sprints
- Wait for signal then sprint in indicated direction
- 10-second maximum efforts
- Combines reaction time with physical output
- Simulates match decision-making under fatigue
- Full recovery for mental clarity

### Cognitive Direction Changes
- Respond to visual/audio cues for direction
- 5 direction changes per set
- Combines physical agility with mental processing
- Focus on quick accurate responses
- Maintain balance and control

## Performance Notes
- **Cognitive Load**: Mental challenges during physical exercise
- **Decision Training**: Improved reaction time under fatigue
- **Neural Sharpening**: Enhanced brain-body coordination
- **Tennis Application**: Better decision-making during matches
