## Reactive Power Session

### Reactive Preparation (15 minutes)
- Reaction time activation
- Neural pathway priming
- Visual and auditory cue training
- Cognitive-physical integration

### Main Training - Reactive Power Development (60 minutes)

**Reactive Tennis Agility:**
- Reaction Court Drills: 20 minutes
- Respond to visual/audio cues
- Unpredictable movement patterns
- Decision-making under fatigue

**Reactive Strength-Power:**
- Signal Deadlifts: 5×3 @ 75% (lift on cue)
- → Reactive Jumps: 5×3 (jump on signal)
- Rest: 3 minutes for mental clarity

**Reactive Hip Power:**
- Cued Hip Thrusts: 4×4 @ 70% (thrust on signal)
- → Direction Bounds: 4×4 (bound on directional cue)
- Rest: 2 minutes between sets

**Reactive Upper Power:**
- Signal Push Press: 4×4 @ 70% (press on cue)
- → Reactive Med Ball: 4×4 (throw on signal)
- Rest: 2 minutes between sets

**Reactive Power Endurance:**
- Reaction Carries: 4×30m (change direction on cue)
- Random Plyometrics: 4×30 seconds (mixed on signals)
- Rest: 90 seconds between sets

### Reactive Recovery (15 minutes)
- Cognitive decompression
- Controlled movement patterns
- Mental clarity restoration

## Quick Exercise Instructions

### Signal Deadlifts
- Wait for visual or audio signal
- Explosive lift immediately upon cue
- Tests reaction time under load
- 75% load allows for quick response
- Combines cognitive and physical demands
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Deadlift Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op9kVnSso6Q)

### Reactive Jumps
- Ready position, wait for signal
- Maximum jump immediately on cue
- Various jump types (vertical, broad, lateral)
- Express deadlift power reactively
- Train rapid force development
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Plyometric Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcY1dI5-Teo)

### Direction Bounds
- Wait for directional cue
- Bound explosively in indicated direction
- Left, right, forward, or diagonal
- Express hip power with decision-making
- Tennis-specific reactive movement
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Plyometric Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcY1dI5-Teo)

### Reactive Med Ball
- Ready position with medicine ball
- Throw on signal in indicated direction
- Various throwing patterns on cue
- Express push press power reactively
- Combine cognitive load with power
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Power Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8aGBKy3a1k)

### Reaction Carries
- Farmer's carry, change direction on cue
- Left, right, or stop signals
- Maintain load while reacting
- Tests stability under cognitive load
- Functional reactive strength
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Farmer's Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8FWv6bUJ7w)

### Random Plyometrics
- Mixed plyometric movements on cues
- Change exercise type on signal
- 30 seconds continuous with variations
- Cognitive flexibility with power
- Unpredictable movement patterns
- **Video Reference**: [Jeff Nippard - Plyometric Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcY1dI5-Teo)

## Performance Notes
- **Reactive Training**: Movements triggered by external cues
- **Cognitive Load**: Mental processing during physical work
- **Tennis Application**: Match-like unpredictable demands
- **Neural Adaptation**: Improved reaction time and decision-making
