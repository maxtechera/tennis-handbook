# Week 4 - Tuesday: Upper Body Power Integration & Tennis Velocity

## Overview

**Phase 2 Upper Body Power with Velocity-Based Training**

Today focuses on upper body power development using velocity-based training principles. This Phase 2 workout emphasizes explosive intent and maximum bar speed rather than just heavy loads.

### Focus Areas
- **Power Integration** - Transitioning from strength to power
- **Velocity-Based Training** - Focus on movement speed and explosiveness
- **Upper Body Power Development** - Pressing and pulling power
- **Tennis Velocity Training** - Explosive tennis-specific movements

### Training Parameters
- **Volume**: 90% (phase transition deload)
- **Intensity**: 85-95% (velocity-based focus)
- **Density**: Moderate-high
- **Duration**: 4 hours 30 minutes

**Main Training (50 min)**:
- **Velocity Mastery Drills**: Explosive groundstrokes with velocity focus
- **Power Serves**: Maximum velocity serve training
- **Explosive Volleys**: Velocity-based volley work
- **Velocity Under Pressure**: Maintain explosiveness in competitive scenarios

**Success Metrics**:
- Shot velocity: Maximum velocity with 80% accuracy
- Movement explosiveness: Explosive recovery between shots
- Velocity maintenance: 90%+ under pressure

### Phase 3: Velocity Movement Preparation (20 min)
**Power-Specific Movement Prep**

**Focus**: Prepare for velocity-based strength training

**Key Elements**:
- Power glute activation with explosive contractions
- Dynamic hip mobility with explosive intent
- Core power activation for stability
- Explosive movement pattern rehearsal

### Phase 4: Upper Body Power Integration (90 min)
**Velocity-Based Strength Training**

**Focus**: Upper body power development with velocity emphasis

#### Primary Exercises

**1. Velocity Bench Press**
- **Sets/Reps**: 5√ó3
- **Load**: 70-80% 1RM (velocity-based)
- **Tempo**: X-1-X-1 (explosive intent)
- **Rest**: 3 minutes
- **Focus**: Maximum bar speed and explosive concentric drive

**2. Explosive Bent-over Row**
- **Sets/Reps**: 4√ó4
- **Load**: 65-75% 1RM (velocity-based)
- **Tempo**: X-1-X-1 (explosive intent)
- **Rest**: 2.5 minutes
- **Focus**: Explosive pulling with maximum velocity

**3. Velocity Overhead Press**
- **Sets/Reps**: 4√ó5
- **Load**: 60-70% 1RM (velocity-based)
- **Tempo**: X-1-X-1 (explosive intent)
- **Rest**: 2 minutes
- **Focus**: Explosive vertical pressing power

**4. Explosive Pull-ups**
- **Sets/Reps**: 3√ó5
- **Load**: Bodyweight with explosive intent
- **Tempo**: X-1-X-1 (explosive intent)
- **Rest**: 2 minutes
- **Focus**: Maximum velocity to bar

**5. Power Landmine Press**
- **Sets/Reps**: 3√ó5 per side
- **Load**: Moderate with explosive intent
- **Tempo**: X-1-X-1 (explosive intent)
- **Rest**: 90 seconds
- **Focus**: Explosive unilateral pressing

#### Power Finisher

**Explosive Medicine Ball Slams**
- **Sets/Reps**: 4√ó5
- **Load**: 3-4kg medicine ball
- **Rest**: 90 seconds
- **Focus**: Maximum velocity and explosive intent

### Phase 5: Power Recovery Integration (20 min)
**Velocity-Focused Recovery**

**Focus**: Recovery optimized for power training adaptations

**Components**:
- **Upper Body Velocity Mobility** (8 min): Target velocity-worked muscle groups
- **Velocity Recovery Breathing** (7 min): 4-7-8 breathing for power recovery
- **Velocity Session Evaluation** (5 min): Document explosive performance metrics

## Key Coaching Points

### Technical Focus
- **Velocity-Based Loading**: Focus on bar speed rather than just weight
- **Explosive Intent**: Maximum velocity on every repetition
- **Movement Quality**: Maintain perfect technique at high velocities
- **Tennis Integration**: Transfer explosive power to tennis-specific movements

### Safety Considerations
- **Spotter Required**: For all explosive bench press sets
- **Velocity Maintenance**: Reduce load if velocity drops significantly
- **Form Priority**: Never compromise technique for velocity
- **Recovery Focus**: Adequate rest between explosive sets

### Progression Markers
- All velocity sets completed with explosive intent
- Tennis velocity maintained throughout session
- Explosive movement quality sustained
- Power integration demonstrated

## Level Modifications
