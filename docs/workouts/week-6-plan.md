# Week 6 - Advanced Power Development & Competition Preparation

## **WEEK 6 OBJECTIVES**

- Peak strength and power development using advanced PAP protocols
- Introduce velocity-based training for optimal load management
- Enhance neural drive and explosive capacity
- Prepare for competition-level tennis demands

---

## **WEEKLY TARGETS & MONITORING**

### **Performance Targets**

- **Strength**: 90-95% 1RM loads with pristine technique
- **Power**: Bar velocity ≥0.8 m/s on speed sets
- **Tennis**: 85-90% intensity with competition patterns
- **Recovery**: HRV within 5% of baseline, sleep quality ≥8/10

### **Auto-Regulation Guidelines**

- **Green Zone** (HRV normal, sleep 8+): Full intensity
- **Yellow Zone** (HRV -5-10%, sleep 6-7): Reduce volume by 20%
- **Red Zone** (HRV -10%+, sleep <6): Active recovery protocols

| Phase       | Activity                      | Duration  | Focus                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Preparation | Competition warm-up protocol  | 45 min    | Match-day routine practice  |
| Competition | Best-of-3 match simulation    | 2-3 hours | Full competition intensity  |
| Recovery    | Competition recovery protocol | 30 min    | Match-day recovery practice |

### **Option B: Peak Recovery Enhancement**

- **Soft Tissue Work**: 45-min massage or self-myofascial release
- **Movement Restoration**: 30-min yoga flow targeting power training areas
- **Mental Recovery**: Competition visualization + relaxation techniques
- **Nutrition Optimization**: Competition nutrition trial

## Sunday – Assessment & Regeneration

### **Weekly Performance Review**

- **Power Metrics**: Compare vertical jump, bar velocities to baseline
- **Tennis Performance**: Serve speed, groundstroke power, movement efficiency
- **Recovery Analysis**: HRV trends, sleep quality, subjective wellness
- **Technical Assessment**: Video analysis of power transfer to tennis

### **Complete Regeneration Protocol**

- **Sleep Optimization**: 9+ hours, prioritize REM recovery
- **Nutritional Reset**: Anti-inflammatory foods, hydration optimization
- **Mental Recovery**: Complete disconnection from training stress
- **Planning**: Week 7 modifications based on adaptation response

## **ADVANCED MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION**

### **Velocity-Based Training Targets**

| Exercise | Load   | Target Velocity | Adaptation     |
| -------- | ------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Squat    | 70-80% | ≥0.8 m/s        | Speed-Strength |
| Deadlift | 60-70% | ≥1.0 m/s        | Power          |
| Press    | 70-80% | ≥0.6 m/s        | Upper Power    |
| Row      | 60-70% | ≥1.2 m/s        | Pulling Power  |

### **PAP Protocol Optimization**

- **Rest Intervals**: 3-8 minutes based on individual response
- **Load Selection**: 85-95% 1RM for conditioning stimulus
- **Volume Management**: 3-5 reps maximum to avoid fatigue
- **Monitoring**: Track power output on explosive exercises

### **Competition Readiness Indicators**

✅ **Physical**: Power metrics within 5% of peak  
✅ **Technical**: Serve accuracy >75%, groundstroke consistency >80%  
✅ **Mental**: Confidence rating ≥8/10, competition excitement  
✅ **Recovery**: HRV stable, sleep quality ≥8/10, energy levels high

### **Weekly Success Metrics**

- **Strength**: Maintain or increase loads at target velocities
- **Power**: Improve explosive exercise performance by 5-10%
- **Tennis**: Increase serve speed and groundstroke power
- **Recovery**: Maintain HRV within optimal range throughout week
- **Readiness**: Demonstrate competition-level performance consistency
