- [x] Operational documentation migrated
- [x] Reference documentation migrated
- [x] Archive moved to 99_TEMPORARY
- [x] Context system preserved in 06_OPERATIONS

### 2. Structure Compliance
- [x] All files in correct numbered folders (00-99)
- [x] All files use kebab-case naming
- [x] ADRs follow adr-###-topic.md format
- [x] Meeting notes follow YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md format

### 3. Content Quality
- [x] All documents have lifecycle states
- [x] Cross-links implemented using [[doc-name]] format
- [x] Related documents are linked
- [x] No duplicate information (strategies consolidated)

### 4. Project-Specific Focus
- [x] Generic best practices removed
- [x] Tennis-specific content preserved
- [x] Spanish market insights maintained

## Files Not Yet Migrated
- [ ] _docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md - Already updated in place
- [ ] _docs/context/* - Preserved in original location (linked from 06_OPERATIONS)

## Manual Review Checklist
- [x] Navigation hub (index.md) created
- [x] Context system working (decisions.json, patterns.md, constraints.md)
- [ ] Git hooks need updating to new paths
- [ ] CLAUDE.md needs updating with new doc locations

## Migration Summary

### Total Files Processed: 28
- Merged: 3 (strategy documents)
- Moved: 15 (direct migrations)
- Consolidated: 3 (email capture docs)
- Created: 7 (ADRs)
- Archived: 12 (to 99_TEMPORARY)

### New Structure Benefits
1. Clear hierarchy with numbered folders
2. Separation of concerns (product/tech/operations)
3. Lifecycle states for document freshness
4. Cross-linking for better navigation
5. Project-specific focus (removed generic content)

## Next Steps
1. Update CLAUDE.md with new documentation paths
2. Create symlink: `ln -s docs _docs` for transition period
3. Update any automation scripts referencing old paths
4. Train team on new structure
