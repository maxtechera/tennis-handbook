# Auto-Regulation & Program Modification

_Dynamic training adjustments based on daily readiness and performance indicators_

---

## Auto-Regulation Strategies

### RPE-Based Training

**The RPE Scale (1-10):**

- **1-3**: Very easy, could continue for hours
- **4-5**: Easy, conversational pace
- **6-7**: Moderate effort, becoming challenging
- **8**: Hard effort, 2-3 reps left in reserve
- **9**: Very hard, 1 rep left in reserve
- **10**: Maximum effort, nothing left

### Daily Adjustments

**Target RPE 8 Prescription:**

**Feeling Excellent (9-10/10 energy):**

- May push to RPE 9
- Can add 1-2 additional sets
- Include challenging exercises

**Feeling Good (7-8/10 energy):**

- Train at prescribed RPE 8
- Complete planned workout
- Maintain exercise selection

**Feeling Average (5-6/10 energy):**

- Reduce to RPE 7
- Monitor form carefully
- May skip accessory work

**Feeling Poor (3-4/10 energy):**

- Reduce to RPE 6 or skip session
- Focus on movement quality
- Consider active recovery

**Feeling Terrible (1-2/10 energy):**

- Recovery day only
- Light movement maximum
- Address sleep/stress issues

### Load Selection

**Daily Readiness Assessment:**

- Choose weights that achieve target RPE
- Adjust based on warm-up feel
- Monitor bar speed and form quality
- Reduce loads if movement velocity drops significantly

**Volume Modification Guidelines:**

**High Readiness Days:**

- May add 10-20% volume
- Include bonus exercises
- Extend conditioning work

**Low Readiness Days:**

- Reduce sets by 20-40%
- Focus on main movements only
- Prioritize movement quality over intensity

---

## Performance-Based Adjustments

### Bar Speed Monitoring

**Velocity-Based Training Principles:**

- **Target Maintenance**: Keep movement velocity above 90% of baseline
- **Load Reduction**: Decrease weight 5-10% if velocity drops significantly
- **Set Termination**: Stop when velocity drops below threshold
- **Recovery Management**: Allow full recovery between sets

**Implementation Protocol:**

1. Establish baseline velocity for each exercise
2. Monitor speed during warm-up sets
3. Adjust working loads based on velocity feedback
4. Terminate sets when speed significantly decreases

### Rep Quality Assessment

**Form Standards:**

**Excellent Form:**

- Continue as prescribed
- May consider load increases
- Full range of motion maintained

**Good Form:**

- Monitor closely
- Complete planned sets
- May reduce load slightly if form degrades

**Declining Form:**

- Reduce reps or load immediately
- Focus on movement quality
- Consider technique work

**Poor Form:**

- Terminate exercise immediately
- Reassess readiness
- Switch to mobility/activation work

### Readiness Questionnaires

**Sleep Quality:**

- Duration and depth of sleep
- Number of awakenings
- Morning alertness

**Energy Level:**

- Overall vitality

**Combined Score Interpretation:**

- **40-50**: Excellent training day - push intensities
- **30-39**: Good training day - proceed as planned
- **20-29**: Moderate training day - slight modifications
- **10-19**: Light training day - significant reductions
- **<10**: Recovery day only

_Effective auto-regulation requires consistent monitoring, honest self-assessment, and willingness to modify training based on current readiness rather than predetermined plans._
