# Performance Nutrition for Tennis Training & Competition

_Strategic nutrition protocols for optimizing tennis performance, recovery, and adaptation_

## Pre-Training & Competition Nutrition

### Timing & Preparation Strategy

**1-2 Hours Before Training/Competition:**¹

**Primary Goals:**

- Optimize energy availability for high-intensity performance²
- Prevent hunger and energy depletion during session³
- Maintain stable blood glucose levels throughout activity⁴
- Minimize gastrointestinal distress and digestive stress⁵

**Macronutrient Strategy:**

**Carbohydrates (30-60g easily digestible):**

- **Purpose**: Primary fuel source for high-intensity tennis movements
- **Sources**: Banana with honey, oatmeal with berries, toast with jam, rice cakes with fruit
- **Timing**: 1-2 hours allows for digestion and glucose availability
- **Individual Variation**: Test different sources during training to identify optimal tolerance

**Protein (15-25g lean sources):**

- **Purpose**: Amino acid availability for muscle protein synthesis and satiety
- **Sources**: Greek yogurt, protein shake, turkey/chicken, cottage cheese, eggs
- **Quality**: Complete amino acid profiles preferred for optimal utilization
- **Digestibility**: Choose sources that digest easily and don't cause GI distress

**Minimal Fat & Fiber:**

- **Rationale**: Slower digestion can cause GI issues during intense activity
- **Strategy**: Save higher fat/fiber foods for post-training meals
- **Exception**: Small amounts of easily digestible fats (nut butters) if well-tolerated

### Pre-Training Meal Examples

**Option 1 - Light Training Session (60-90 minutes):**

- 1 medium banana with 1 tablespoon almond butter
- 8-12 oz water
- Optional: 100mg caffeine (coffee or tea) 30-45 minutes before

**Option 2 - Intense Training Session (90+ minutes):**

- 1 cup oatmeal with mixed berries and 1 tablespoon honey
- 6 oz Greek yogurt
- 16 oz water with electrolytes
- Coffee (if habitual user)

**Option 3 - Early Morning Training:**

- Protein smoothie: banana, protein powder, spinach, water/milk
- 1 slice whole grain toast with 1 tablespoon jam
- 12-16 oz water
- Coffee with minimal milk/cream

**Option 4 - Competition Day:**

- 2 slices whole grain toast with banana slices and honey
- 4-6 oz Greek yogurt
- 16-20 oz water with light electrolytes
- Familiar foods only (nothing new on competition day)

### Caffeine Strategy for Performance

**Evidence-Based Dosing:**⁶

- **Optimal Range**: 3-6mg per kg body weight (200-400mg for most athletes)⁷
- **Timing**: 30-45 minutes before training for peak blood levels⁸
- **Individual Tolerance**: Start with lower doses (100-200mg) if caffeine naive⁹
- **Habituation**: Regular users may need higher doses for same effect¹⁰

**Sources & Applications:**

- **Coffee**: 95-200mg per 8 oz cup (varies by preparation)
- **Tea**: 25-50mg per 8 oz cup (green tea, black tea)
- **Pre-workout Supplements**: Measured doses for consistency
- **Avoid**: Energy drinks with excessive sugar or unknown stimulants

**Competition Considerations:**

- Use only familiar caffeine sources and doses
- Time intake to peak during most important matches
- Consider afternoon matches when timing caffeine intake
- Monitor for anxiety or jitters that could hurt performance

## During Training & Competition Nutrition

### For Sessions >90 Minutes¹¹

**Carbohydrate Requirements:**

- **Target**: 30-60g carbohydrates per hour of activity¹²
- **Start Early**: Begin intake within first 15-30 minutes¹³
- **Consistent Intake**: Every 15-20 minutes rather than large boluses¹⁴
- **Individual Tolerance**: Adjust based on GI comfort and energy needs¹⁵

**Optimal Carbohydrate Sources:**

**Sports Drinks (6-8% carbohydrate):**

- **Advantages**: Rapid absorption, electrolyte replacement, familiar taste
- **Application**: Primary source for most tennis athletes during long sessions
- **Glucose/Fructose Mix**: Multiple transport pathways for enhanced absorption
- **Temperature**: Cool drinks (50-59°F) enhance absorption and palatability

**Solid Food Options:**

- **Bananas**: Natural source with potassium, easy to digest
- **Dates**: High glycemic index for rapid glucose availability
- **Energy Gels**: Concentrated carbohydrates with minimal volume
- **Sports Bars**: For longer sessions or between matches

**Timing Strategy:**

- **First Hour**: Sports drink primarily
- **After 60 minutes**: Add solid food if tolerated
- **Between Sets**: Small sips, avoid large volumes
- **Change of Ends**: Strategic intake during natural breaks

### Hydration During Activity

**Fluid Replacement Goals:**

- **Rate**: 6-8 oz every 15-20 minutes during activity
- **Total**: Approximately 16-24 oz per hour depending on sweat rate
- **Temperature**: Cool fluids for better absorption and core cooling
- **Palatability**: Choose flavors that encourage consistent intake

**Sweat Rate Assessment:**

- **Method**: Weigh before/after training (nude weight for accuracy)
- **Calculation**: (Pre-weight - Post-weight + Fluid intake) / Time = Sweat rate
- **Individual Variation**: Ranges from 1-3+ liters per hour
- **Environmental Factors**: Heat, humidity, court surface affect sweat rate

**Electrolyte Replacement:**

- **Sodium**: 200-300mg per 8 oz for sessions >60 minutes
- **Potassium**: Important for muscle function and cramping prevention
- **Magnesium**: Support for muscle contraction and energy metabolism
- **Individual Needs**: Heavy sweaters may need higher concentrations

### Competition-Specific Protocols

**Tournament Play Considerations:**

- **Between Sets**: Small sips only (30-60 seconds)
- **Set Breaks**: More substantial intake during longer breaks
- **Between Matches**: Full rehydration and refueling protocol
- **Multiple Matches**: Strategic nutrition for sustained energy

**Practical Competition Strategy:**

- **Familiar Products Only**: Never try new foods/drinks during competition
- **Portable Options**: Easy to consume and transport
- **Weather Adaptations**: Adjust intake based on environmental conditions
- **Backup Plans**: Multiple options in case of GI issues or preferences
