## Marco Luparo - Tennis-Specific Conditioning

### Tennis-Specific Priorities

**Wrist/Forearm Complex (Primary Focus):**

- **Applications**: Racket control, spin generation, power transfer
- **Training Focus**: Progressive strengthening in multiple planes
- **Injury Prevention**: Tennis elbow and wrist injury prevention

**Tennis Movement Hierarchy:**

1. **Wrist Control**: Foundation for all tennis skills
2. **Core Rotational Power**: Energy transfer from legs to racket
3. **Shoulder Stability**: Injury prevention and performance
4. **Hip Mobility**: Court coverage and stroke mechanics

### Exercise Categories & Applications

**Wrist Strengthening Protocols:**

- **Wrist Curls**: 2-3 sets × 12-15 reps for forearm flexor strength
- **Wrist Extensions**: 2-3 sets × 12-15 reps for extensor strength and tennis elbow prevention
- **Pronation/Supination**: 2 sets × 10 each direction for racket control
- **Grip Variations**: Multiple grip positions and resistance levels

**Core Rotational Power:**

- **Cable/Band Rotations**: 3 sets × 10 each direction for stroke power

## Dr. Mike Israetel - Renaissance Periodization

### Evidence-Based Programming Principles

**Progressive Overload Framework:**

- **Systematic Progression**: Planned increase in training stimulus over time
- **Volume Landmarks**: Understanding minimum effective dose vs. maximum recoverable volume
- **Load Progression**: Strategic increase in training loads for adaptation
- **Adaptation Monitoring**: Tracking progress and adjusting programming

**Periodization Science:**

- **Block Periodization**: Focused training blocks for specific adaptations
- **Undulating Periodization**: Varied training stimulus within weeks
- **Deload Strategy**: Planned reduction in training stress every 4-6 weeks
- **Competition Preparation**: Tapering and peaking protocols

### Concurrent Training Management

**Interference Effect Understanding:**

- **Magnitude**: Endurance training can reduce strength gains by 20-30%
- **Mechanisms**: Competing cellular signaling pathways
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Timing, modality selection, and programming adjustments
- **Individual Variation**: Different athletes show varying interference levels

**Programming Solutions:**

- **Exercise Selection**: Prioritize compound movements that transfer to sport
- **Timing Considerations**: Separate strength and endurance by 6+ hours when possible
- **Modality Selection**: Cycling interferes less with leg strength than running
- **Volume Management**: Use minimum effective dose for non-priority qualities

### Recovery & Adaptation Protocols

**Deload Programming:**

- **Frequency**: Every 4-6 weeks based on training stress accumulation
- **Volume Reduction**: 40-60% reduction in training volume
- **Intensity Maintenance**: Keep some high-intensity work for neural maintenance
- **Philosophy**: _"Prepares the lifter for more hard training"_ through fatigue dissipation

**Recovery Science Applications:**

- **Sleep Requirements**: 7-9 hours optimal for adaptation and performance
- **Protein Timing**: 20-40g post-workout for muscle protein synthesis
- **Hydration Impact**: 2% dehydration reduces performance by 10-15%
- **Stress Management**: Managing total life stress for optimal adaptation
