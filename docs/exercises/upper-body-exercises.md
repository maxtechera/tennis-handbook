# Upper Body Exercise Database

_Evidence-based upper body strength training for tennis performance and injury prevention_

:::info **Tennis Performance Research**
Recent research demonstrates that upper limb muscle strength influences groundstroke performance by 59.3%, making targeted upper body training essential for tennis success¹. Studies show that proper strength training "emulates the sequential coordination involved in ground stroke production" while developing "stabilizing musculature that protects body parts from stressful actions"².
:::

:::tip **Biomechanical Foundation**
Tennis performance requires "a number of body segments to be coordinated in such a way that a high racquet speed is generated at impact"³. Efficient function with maximal performance and minimal injury risk requires "optimum activation of all the links in the kinetic chain designed for power"⁴.
