[████████████] Building Base → Power Introduction → Integration
Volume: 100% → 115% → 130% | Intensity: 60-70% → 70-80% → 75-85%

PHASE 2: Power Development (Weeks 4-6)  
[████████████] Deload → Heavy Loading → Max Strength
Volume: 50% → 110% → 125% | Intensity: 40-50% → 80-90% → 85-95%

## 7. Recommendations

### Critical Improvements Needed

#### 1. Research Citation Documentation
**Issue**: 224 citations referenced but not documented  
**Recommendation**: Create comprehensive reference list with:
- Full citations in APA format
- Link to specific exercises/protocols
- Evidence quality ratings
- Implementation notes

#### 2. Recovery Volume Enhancement
**Issue**: Recovery drops below 10% target after Week 3  
**Recommendations**:
- Add 15-20 min daily recovery protocols
- Implement mandatory recovery sessions
- Include sleep hygiene protocols
- Add HRV-guided recovery days

#### 3. Individual Customization Framework
**Issue**: No adaptation guidelines for different levels  
**Recommendations**:
- Create scaling options (70%, 85%, 100%)
- Add assessment protocols for readiness
- Include modification guidelines
- Develop auto-regulation framework

#### 4. Monitoring and Tracking System
**Issue**: No integrated monitoring system  
**Recommendations**:
- Daily readiness questionnaire
- Weekly performance markers
- Monthly assessment protocols
- Digital tracking integration

#### 5. Injury Prevention Protocols
**Issue**: Limited specific injury prevention work  
**Recommendations**:
- Add daily 10-min injury prevention routine
- Include movement screening protocols
- Implement load management guidelines
- Create return-to-play protocols

### Strengths to Maintain
1. ✅ Excellent periodization structure
2. ✅ Proper progressive overload
3. ✅ Elite player method integration
4. ✅ Appropriate training distribution
5. ✅ Scientific training zones

### Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: Add research citations and increase recovery volume
2. **Short-term**: Develop monitoring system and injury prevention
3. **Long-term**: Create full customization framework

## Conclusion

The 12-week elite tennis program demonstrates excellent periodization and progressive overload principles with strong integration of elite player methods. The primary areas for improvement are documentation of research citations, enhancement of recovery protocols, and development of individualization frameworks. With these improvements, this program would represent a truly comprehensive, evidence-based training system suitable for elite tennis performance.
