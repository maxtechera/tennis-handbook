# Email Capture Implementation Guide - MAX-46

## âœ… What's Already Done

1. **Frontend Components** - All email capture UI components are built and integrated:
   - EmailCaptureForm (4 variants: hero, inline, popup, footer)
   - EmailCapturePopup (3-minute timer)
   - EmailCaptureBar (sticky footer)
   - Spanish translations
   - GDPR compliance

2. **Homepage Integration** - Email capture is live on:
   - Hero section form
   - Timed popup (3 minutes)
   - Sticky footer bar (5 seconds)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. ConvertKit Setup (Today - 30 minutes)

1. **Sign up at ConvertKit** (https://convertkit.com)
   - Use the Creator plan ($29/month after 14-day trial)
   - Best for content creators and course sellers

2. **Create Form in ConvertKit**:
   - Name: "Tennis Handbook Subscribers"
   - Add custom fields:
     - `source` (text) - tracks where they signed up
     - `language` (text) - for Spanish vs English
   - Enable double opt-in for GDPR compliance

3. **Get API Credentials**:
   - Account Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ API Secret
   - Copy your API Secret (starts with `sk_`)
   - Find your Form ID in the form URL

### 2. Deploy API Endpoint (1 hour)

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended for Docusaurus)**

Create `api/subscribe.js` in your project root:

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Enable CORS for your domain
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://tennishandbook.com');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST');
  
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
  }

  const { email, source = 'website', consent, language = 'en' } = req.body;

  // Validate
  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email' });
  }

  if (!consent) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Consent required' });
  }

  try {
    // Add to ConvertKit
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.convertkit.com/v3/forms/${process.env.CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID}/subscribe`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          api_secret: process.env.CONVERTKIT_API_SECRET,
          email,
          fields: { source, language },
          tags: ['tennis-handbook', source, language]
        })
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(data.message || 'Failed to subscribe');
    }

    return res.status(200).json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Subscribe error:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ 
      error: 'Failed to subscribe. Please try again.' 
    });
  }
}
```

**Vercel Environment Variables**:
```bash
CONVERTKIT_API_SECRET=sk_your_secret_here
CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID=your_form_id_here
```

**Option B: Netlify Functions**

Create `netlify/functions/subscribe.js`:
```javascript
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Similar implementation but with Netlify syntax
  // Return { statusCode, body: JSON.stringify(data) }
};
```

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration (15 minutes)

1. **Update EmailCaptureForm.tsx** endpoint URL:
```javascript
const API_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? 'https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/subscribe'
  : 'http://localhost:3000/api/subscribe';
```

2. **Add to docusaurus.config.ts**:
```javascript
customFields: {
  emailApiUrl: process.env.EMAIL_API_URL || '/api/subscribe',
},
```

### 4. Create Lead Magnet PDF (2 hours)

**"7-Day Elite Tennis Workout Plan" Content Structure**:

Hey [Name],

Welcome to the Tennis Handbook community!

Your 7-Day Elite Tennis Workout Plan is attached to this email.

Here's what to do next:
1. Print out the PDF (or save it to your phone)

Quick tip: The pros don't train harder, they train smarter. This plan shows you exactly how.

Let's get after it!
[Your name]

P.S. Tomorrow I'll share the #1 mistake club players make with their fitness (and how to fix it).
```

**Email 2: Day 1 - Common Mistake**
```
Subject: The #1 fitness mistake tennis players make

[Name],

How was Day 1 of your workout plan?

Here's what most players get wrong:
They train like bodybuilders, not athletes.

The pros? They focus on explosive power and injury prevention.

That's why your plan includes:
- Medicine ball work (power)
- Single-leg exercises (balance)
- Core rotation (injury prevention)

Tomorrow: The recovery secret that changed Djokovic's career.

Keep pushing!
[Your name]
```

**Email 3: Day 3 - Recovery Secret**
```
Subject: Djokovic's recovery secret (it's not what you think)

[Name],

You're on Day 3 now. Feeling it?

Here's something interesting:
Djokovic spends MORE time on recovery than training.

Not just stretching. We're talking:
- Specific tendon loading protocols
- Timed mobility work
- Strategic rest periods

Your Day 4 active recovery is based on these exact principles.

Friday: The one exercise every tennis player should do (but 90% skip).

Almost there!
[Your name]
```

**Email 4: Day 5 - Key Exercise**
```
Subject: The one exercise every tennis player needs

[Name],

Day 5! You're crushing it.

The exercise? Single-leg RDLs.

Why pros swear by it:
- Prevents hamstring injuries
- Improves serve power
- Fixes hip imbalances

You did these on Day 1. Now you know why.

Next email: How to know if your training is actually working.

Stay strong!
[Your name]
```

**Email 5: Day 7 - Next Steps**
```
Subject: You did it! Here's what's next...

[Name],

Congrats on completing your first week! ðŸŽ‰

How do you feel?

Here's how to know it's working:
- Less fatigue during matches
- More explosive first steps
- Fewer aches and pains

Want to keep going?

I'm working on something special:
A complete 12-week program with video demonstrations.

Interested? Reply and let me know.

Either way, keep training smart!
