## Quick Reference Guidelines

### Tendon Loading Principles

**Load Requirements:**

- **Threshold**: >70% 1RM for significant adaptation
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for structural changes
- **Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week optimal
- **Recovery**: 48-72 hours between sessions

### HSR Protocol Essentials

**Core Parameters:**

- **Sets**: 3-4 sets per exercise
- **Reps**: 6-8 repetitions
- **Tempo**: 3-4 second eccentric, explosive concentric
- **Load**: 70-85% 1RM

### Tennis-Specific Applications

**Achilles Complex:**

- Heavy calf raises (bilateral â†’ unilateral)
- Enhanced court movement and landing mechanics

**Patellar Tendon:**

- Slow tempo squats with pause
- Improved jumping and direction change ability

**Shoulder Complex:**

- Progressive external rotation loading
- Enhanced serve deceleration and overhead stability

**Forearm Complex:**

- Eccentric wrist extensions/flexions
- Tennis/golfer's elbow prevention

## Implementation Pathway

### Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-4)

1. **Movement Pattern Establishment**: Learn proper technique
2. **Light Loading**: Begin tendon adaptation process
3. **Pain Monitoring**: Establish baseline tolerance
4. **Tennis Integration**: Coordinate with court training

### Development Phase (Weeks 5-8)

1. **HSR Implementation**: Progress to therapeutic loading
2. **Load Progression**: Systematic intensity increases
3. **Function Integration**: Sport-specific applications
4. **Adaptation Monitoring**: Track strength and symptoms

### Integration Phase (Weeks 9+)

1. **Plyometric Addition**: Combine HSR with explosive training
2. **Tennis-Specific Training**: Match-specific applications
3. **Performance Optimization**: Peak tissue function
4. **Maintenance Planning**: Long-term health strategies
