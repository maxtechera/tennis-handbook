        | Slow, controlled movement  | Better movement efficiency  |\n\n**Core Integration Detailed Instructions:**\n\n**Hanging Leg Raises:**\n- **SETUP**: Hang from pull-up bar with overhand grip, arms fully extended, body straight\n- **STARTING POSITION**: Let legs hang straight down, engage core to prevent swaying\n- **LIFT PHASE**: Slowly raise knees toward chest by contracting lower abdominals\n- **TOP POSITION**: Bring knees as high as possible (ideally to chest level), hold for 2 seconds\n- **LOWERING**: Control the descent slowly over 3-4 seconds, resist gravity\n- **FORM CHECK**: No swinging or using momentum - all movement from core muscles\n- **PROGRESSION**: If too difficult, start with bent knee raises; if easy, progress to straight leg raises\n- **BREATHING**: Exhale during lift phase, inhale during lowering\n\n**Dead Bug + Reach:**\n- **SETUP**: Lie on back, arms extended toward ceiling, knees bent at 90 degrees\n- **STARTING POSITION**: Press lower back flat against floor, engage core muscles\n- **MOVEMENT**: Slowly extend opposite arm overhead and opposite leg straight\n- **EXTENSION**: Arm reaches back toward floor, leg extends until heel nearly touches ground\n- **CONTROL**: Move arm and leg simultaneously, maintain core stability throughout\n- **RETURN**: Slowly bring arm and leg back to starting position with control\n- **ALTERNATION**: Complete all reps on one side, then switch to other arm/leg combination\n- **CORE FOCUS**: Never let lower back arch off the floor - this is the key challenge\n\n### Tennis-Specific Tendon Health\n\n|

Plank + Clamshells:**\n- **SIDE PLANK SETUP**: Lie on side, forearm on ground perpendicular to body, body in straight line\n- **ALIGNMENT**: Stack hips, shoulders, and feet - no sagging or pike position\n- **HOLD**: Maintain perfect position for 30 seconds, breathe normally throughout\n- **CLAMSHELL TRANSITION**: Immediately after plank, bend knees 90 degrees, keep feet together\n- **CLAMSHELL MOVEMENT**: Lift top knee up while keeping feet together, feel glute activation\n- **REPETITIONS**: 10 clamshells with control, focus on glute working not hip flexor\n- **PROGRESSION**: Once easy, add single-arm reach during plank hold\n- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Builds hip stability for wide defensive shots and lateral movement\n\n**Calf Raise + Tibialis:**\n- **CALF RAISE SETUP**: Stand on edge of step with balls of feet on step, heels hanging off\n- **CALF RAISE EXECUTION**: Rise up on toes as high as possible, hold 1 second at top\n- **ECCENTRIC FOCUS**: Lower heels slowly over 3 full seconds below step level\n- **RANGE**: Full stretch at bottom, maximum contraction at top\n- **TIBIALIS SETUP**: Stand with heels on step, toes hanging off (opposite position)\n- **TIBIALIS EXECUTION**: Lift toes up toward shins as high as possible, hold briefly\n- **CONTROL**: Lower toes slowly, feel work in front of shins (tibialis anterior)\n- **PROGRESSION**: Add weight vest or dumbbells when bodyweight becomes easy\n\n## Movement Quality Enhancement (08:25-08:45)\n\n### Targeted Correctives from Monday Screen\n\n| Movement Issue                    | Corrective

extended, body straight\n- **STARTING POSITION**: Let legs hang straight down, engage core to prevent swaying\n- **LIFT PHASE**: Slowly raise knees toward chest by contracting lower abdominals\n- **TOP POSITION**: Bring knees as high as possible (ideally to chest level), hold for 2 seconds\n- **LOWERING**: Control the descent slowly over 3-4 seconds, resist gravity\n- **FORM CHECK**: No swinging or using momentum - all movement from core muscles\n- **PROGRESSION**: If too difficult, start with bent knee raises; if easy, progress to straight leg raises\n- **BREATHING**: Exhale during lift phase, inhale during lowering\n\n**Dead Bug + Reach:**\n- **SETUP**: Lie on back, arms extended toward ceiling, knees bent at 90 degrees\n- **STARTING POSITION**: Press lower back flat against floor, engage core muscles\n- **MOVEMENT**: Slowly extend opposite arm overhead and opposite leg straight\n- **EXTENSION**: Arm reaches back toward floor, leg extends until heel nearly touches ground\n- **CONTROL**: Move arm and leg simultaneously, maintain core stability throughout\n- **RETURN**: Slowly bring arm and leg back to starting position with control\n- **ALTERNATION**: Complete all reps on one side, then switch to other arm/leg combination\n- **CORE FOCUS**: Never let lower back arch off the floor - this is the key challenge\n\n### Tennis-Specific Tendon Health\n\n| Exercise

Plank + Clamshells:**\n- **SIDE PLANK SETUP**: Lie on side, forearm on ground perpendicular to body, body in straight line\n- **ALIGNMENT**: Stack hips, shoulders, and feet - no sagging or pike position\n- **HOLD**: Maintain perfect position for 30 seconds, breathe normally throughout\n- **CLAMSHELL TRANSITION**: Immediately after plank, bend knees 90 degrees, keep feet together\n- **CLAMSHELL MOVEMENT**: Lift top knee up while keeping feet together, feel glute activation\n- **REPETITIONS**: 10 clamshells with control, focus on glute working not hip flexor\n- **PROGRESSION**: Once easy, add single-arm reach during plank hold\n- **TENNIS APPLICATION**: Builds hip stability for wide defensive shots and lateral movement\n\n**Calf Raise + Tibialis:**\n- **CALF RAISE SETUP**: Stand on edge of step with balls of feet on step, heels hanging off\n- **CALF RAISE EXECUTION**: Rise up on toes as high as possible, hold 1 second at top\n- **ECCENTRIC FOCUS**: Lower heels slowly over 3 full seconds below step level\n- **RANGE**: Full stretch at bottom, maximum contraction at top\n- **TIBIALIS SETUP**: Stand with heels on step, toes hanging off (opposite position)\n- **TIBIALIS EXECUTION**: Lift toes up toward shins as high as possible, hold briefly\n- **CONTROL**: Lower toes slowly, feel work in front of shins (tibialis anterior)\n- **PROGRESSION**: Add weight vest or dumbbells when bodyweight becomes easy\n\n## Movement Quality Enhancement (08:25-08:45)\n\n### Targeted Correctives from Monday Screen\n\n| Movement Issue                    | Corrective
